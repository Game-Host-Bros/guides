Adding mods to Conan Exiles is a great way to mix-up the gameplay and try new things, whether it's a simple quality-of-life mod or a total overhaul, there'll likely be something that's perfect for you. This guide will cover where to find and add mods to your [Conan Exiles server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/conan-exiles-server-hosting/).

## Installing Mods To Your Conan Exiles Server

You will need to know how to get a Workshop ID for each mod you want to install. You can [view all the Conan Exiles mods here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/440900/workshop/).

Once you find the mod you want you need to copy the URL. Let's use this URL for example: [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3357115923](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3357115923). The Workshop ID is the numbers at the end of the URL, in this case the Workshop ID is `3357115923`.

<Steps>
1. Access to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Conan Exiles Server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Enter `modlist.txt` in the home directory.
4. Paste the Workshop ID of the Mod you'd like to install, for example if I wanted to install this mod [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3357115923](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3357115923) It should look like this, one per line:
   
   ```txt title="modlist.txt"
   3357115923
   3357758627
   3299875004
   ```

   - The Workshop ID for this mod is `3357115923`, this id can be found at the end of the Steam Workshop URL.
   - To change the mod load order simply rearrange them in the list and restart your server.
5. Start your server.
</Steps>

The mods will automatically download and enable once your server starts.
