In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of uploading an existing world to your [Conan Exiles server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/conan-exiles-server-hosting/).

You may also refer to this guide on how to [upload files to your game server.](/getting-started/uploading-files/)

:::note
Things to note before getting started:

- This will **delete or overwrite** any progress you have made on the server.
- If you need to install mods with your save, they can be added following [this guide](/games/conan-exiles/installing-mods/), this guide assumes that your save isn't modded.
- If your save isn't on the Default map you will have to change the map on your server, our guide for this can be found [here](/games/conan-exiles/change-map/).
