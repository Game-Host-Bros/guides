By default, Day Of Defeat will slowly download files directly from the server itself, this can be slow for players who are trying to connect to your server. Game Host Bros offers FastDL so players can download the files faster. By default it will sync all custom files inside the `/dod/`directory on your server.

## How To Sync Your FastDL

1. Go to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. On the left-hand side, go to `Tools > FastDL`.
3. Click `Sync FastDL`.
4. Copy the address to your FastDL it looks something like this: `http://lonestar.gamehostbros.com/a8341d7b`
5. Open your `server.cfg`, located in `dod/server.cfg`.
6. Add or update `sv_downloadurl "http://lonestar.gamehostbros.com/a8341d7b"` into your server.cfg (Replace the URL with your unique FastDL url)
7. Restart your server.
