This is what you do if you need to change the map on your [DOD server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/day-of-defeat-server-hosting/).

## Uploading Your Custom Map

Maps are commonly found from public FastDL repositories, or sites such as GameBanana. Your server will need to be restarted so our FastDL system can automatically sync your added files, this is required as these files will not be served to connecting users until a sync is completed.

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com) and `Stop` your DOD server.
2. Using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your map.bsp to `valve/maps`.
3. Start your server.
</Steps>

## Changing Your DOD Server Default Map

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com) and select your DOD server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Default Map` setting and enter your desired map.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>
