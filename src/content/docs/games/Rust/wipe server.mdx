Wiping your server is a great way of keeping gameplay fresh, by performing cycled wipes - full wipes specifically, you're effectively establishing equal footing between new and veteran players.

Here are the most common ways to wipe your [Rust server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/rust-server-hosting/). 

:::note
Certain wipes are **Forced** wipes, these occur when Rust updates (Typically on the first Thursday of every month).

2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Navigate to `/server/rust/`.
4. Delete all of the `player.blueprint` files.
5. Start your server.
</Steps>

**Files to Delete:**
