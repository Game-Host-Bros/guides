## Wipe Your Server :badge[Recommended]{variant=success}

Before switching to a custom map, we recommend performing a [Map Wipe](/games/rust/wipe-server/#map-wipe) or [Full Wipe](/games/rust/wipe-server/#full-wipe).

- [BP Wipe](/games/rust/wipe-server/#blueprint-bp-wipe)
- [Full Wipe](/games/rust/wipe-server/#full-wipe)
- [Map Wipe](/games/rust/wipe-server/#map-wipe)
