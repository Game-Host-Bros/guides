Installing plugins on your [Rust server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/rust-server-hosting/) can enhance gameplay and add new features. Game Host Bros makes it easy to enable Oxide, which is required for most plugins.

## How To Enable Oxide
Here you will learn to install the Oxide modding framework. This is required for all Rust plugins to function.
<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Rust server.
2. Navigate to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` in the left sidebar.
3. Find the `Modding Framework` option and change it from vanilla to `oxide`.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

## How To Install Plugins
Once Oxide is enabled, you can start adding plugins to your server:
<Steps>
1. In the sidebar go to `Management > File Manager`.
2. Navigate to the `oxide/plugins/` directory.
3. Upload your plugin files (usually ending in .cs) to this directory.
4. Check if the plugin is loaded by typing `o.plugins` into the server console.
</Steps>

:::note
You can also install some of the most common Rust plugins directly from our panel by going to `Tools > Mod Manager`. Some of these may require additional configuration.

## How To Install Extensions
Some plugins require additional extensions to function properly. Here's how to install them:
<Steps>
1. In the file manager, go to the `RustDedicated_Data/Managed/` directory (This is the most common location, but refer to your plugin documentation).
2. Upload the extension files (ending in .dll) to this directory.
3. Restart your server.
