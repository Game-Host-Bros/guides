Here is how to ban, or unban, a player on your Rust Server.

## How to Ban a Player
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your Rust server.
3. In the console type `/ban "user_name" ["optional_reason"]`. 
</Steps>
Replace `user_name` with the player's username (leaving the quotes) on the server and `["optional_reason"]` with the reason for this ban, noting that the reason field is optional.

To ban a player by their Steam ID, you can use the following command: `/banid "Steam_ID" ["optional_reason"]`.

## How to Unban a Player

Once a player has been banned, they can only be unbanned through their Steam ID, or by editing the ban list file. Most players find it more convenient to unban through their Steam ID instead of having to manually stop and start the server.
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your Rust server.
3. In the console type `/unban user_ID`
</Steps>
Replace `user_ID` with the Steam ID of the user.
