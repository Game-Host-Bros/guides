Installing plugins on your Counter-Strike: Source server can enhance gameplay and add new features. Game Host Bros makes it easy to enable SourceMod, which is required for most plugins.

## How To Enable SourceMod

1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. Navigate to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` in the left sidebar.
3. Find the `Enable Sourcemod` option and change its value to `1`.
4. Restart your server.

## How To Install Plugins

Once SourceMod is enabled, you can start adding plugins to your server:

1. In the sidebar go to `Management > File Manager`.
2. Navigate to the `cstrike/addons/sourcemod/plugins/` directory.
3. Upload your plugin files (usually ending in .smx) to this directory.
4. Restart your server or use the `sm plugins refresh` command in the server console.


## How To Install Extensions

Some plugins require additional extensions to function properly. Here's how to install them:

1. In the file manager, go to the `cstrike/addons/sourcemod/extensions/` directory.
2. Upload the extension files (ending in .so for Linux) to this directory.
3. If the extension came with a .cfg file, upload it to `cstrike/cfg/sourcemod/`.
4. Restart your server.

Always make sure you're using extensions compatible with Linux and your SourceMod version.
