Here's how to download and then upload a custom map to your DayZ Server. In this example, we'll be using the [Melkart_Official Map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2716445223).

## Downloading A Custom Map

<Steps>
1. Subscribe to the map on Steam [Melkart_Official Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2716445223).
2. Find server files to download, for example [Melkart_Official Server Files](https://github.com/RafaelLunaC/Melkart-Server).
3. Select the version you want, for example `Melkart1.25.rar`, then on the right-hand side click the download icon.
4. Extract the downloaded contents.
</Steps>

This is what you should now see:

<FileTree>
  - Downloads
    - Melkart1.25
      - **empty.melkart** 
        - **..**
   </FileTree>

## Uploading A Custom Map

Here's to upload a custom map to your DayZ server, this will also cover installing [Melkart_Official](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2716445223) as a mod to your server.

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your DayZ server.
2. [Upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/#using-sftp) `empty.melkart` to the `mpmissions` folder on your server.
3. Export and [Upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/) a `modlist.html` to your server, following our [Installing DayZ Mods Guide](/games/dayz/installing-mods/).
</Steps>

<FileTree>
  - mpmissions
    - **empty.melkart** 
      - ..
    - dayzOffline.enoch/
    - dayzOffline.sakhal/
    - dayzOffline.chernarusplus/

   </FileTree>

## Enabling Your Custom Map

Following the above steps, here's how to enable your custom map, using [Melkart_Official](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2716445223) as an example.

<Steps>

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your DayZ server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Open `serverDZ.cfg`.
4. Scroll down and edit `template=` to `empty.melkart`.
5. Click save and then start your server.
</Steps>

Here's what your serverDZ.cfg should now look like:

```ini title="serverDZ.cfg"
   
class Missions
{
    class DayZ
    {
        template="empty.melkart"; // Mission to load on server startup. <MissionName>.<TerrainName>
					      // Vanilla mission: dayzOffline.chernarusplus
					      // DLC mission: dayzOffline.enoch
    };
};

   ```

:::note 
You can follow the same format for other custom maps from the Steam Workshop, however always remember to follow any instructions that the Map Author may include.

The `template=` name, is the name of the map folder uploaded to `mpmissions` on your server. The naming scheme for this is officially `<MissionName>.<TerrainName>`.
