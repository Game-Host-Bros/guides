## Direct Connecting

<Steps>

2. Copy the [server IP address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap7DtDF-wYg) from the sidebar.
3. Open DayZ.
4. From the main menu, select `Servers > Direct Connect`.
5. In the IP address field, paste the copied server IP, replace the port of 2302 with your server port, and click `Connect`.
