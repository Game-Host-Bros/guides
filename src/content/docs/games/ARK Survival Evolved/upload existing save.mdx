Here is how to upload existing saves to your [Ark Survival Evolved Server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/ark-survival-evolved-server-hosting/).

## Locating Your Existing Steam Ark Survival Evolved Saves

First you'll need to locate your existing world, follow these steps to do this.
<Steps>
1. Open Steam and navigate to your `Library`.
2. Right-Click Ark Survival Evolved and hover `Manage > Browse Local Files`.
3. Navigate to `ShooterGame\Saved\SavedArksLocal`.
4. Find the `.arktribe` `.arkprofile` and `TheIsland.ark` files.
   <FileTree>
   - ShooterGame
     - Saved
       - SavedArksLocal
         - **1616480944.arktribe**
         - **LocalPlayer.arkprofile** Rename this to your **STEAMID64.arkprofile**
         - **TheIsland.ark**
   </FileTree>

</Steps>
:::tip
If you want to upload your settings aswell, they'll be located in `ShooterGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`. You'll need to copy `Game.ini` and `GameUserSettings.ini`
:::

Note that `.arkprofile` will need to be renamed from `LocalPlayer.arkprofile`, you'll have to change this to [YourSteamID64.arkprofile]. Can be found [Here](https://steamid.io/)
