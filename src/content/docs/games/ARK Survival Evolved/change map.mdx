Like any major change, we recommend creating a [Backup](/getting-started/backups/) before proceeding

Things to note:
- Player data will reset by default, to keep your character first connect to your server, then you must travel to an [Obelisk (Tribute Terminal)](https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/CrossARK_Transfers#How_to_Transfer), where you will then be able to upload your character, creatures, and stash your items. 

- Upload your Creatures to `Creatures` and your items to `Ark Data`.
- Things such as saddles will need to be un-equipped and then uploaded to Ark Data, uploading creatures will also remove them from your current map.

- Upon changing map and loading in, click `Create Character > Download character`, your items and creatures can then be retrieved from an Obelisk on your new map.
