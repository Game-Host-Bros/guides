You **MUST** convert any single player save to a multiplayer save on your local PC first before uploading it to your server. Doing this means the host doesn't keep their inventory so store it or give it to a friend first.

## Locating your existing Sons Of The Forest save files
To start we first need to get your existing save file from your local PC.
<Steps>
1. Press `Win + R` on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.
2. Copy and paste `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\SinglePlayer` into the Run window and press OK.
3. Here you will see a folder with random numbers, inside this folder you will find your `SaveData.zip`.
</Steps>
## Convert your single player save to a multiplayer save.
<Steps>
1. After you've completed the above and copied your `SaveData.zip` file, move it to `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\Multiplayer`.
2. Open Sons of the forest and click `Multiplayer > Host Game > Continue > Load Game`, and select the world you want and click `Start`.
3. Once in the game manually save the game using a Tarp or Tent and then close the game.
4. Navigate to `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\Multiplayer` and copy the newly created save.
