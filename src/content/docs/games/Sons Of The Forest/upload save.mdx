In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of uploading an existing world and player save file to your [Sons Of The Forest server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/sons-of-the-forest-server-hosting/).

If you get stuck at any time, Game Host Bros offers free save transfers. Just reach out to a bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr)

You **MUST** convert any single player save to a multiplayer save on your local PC before uploading it to your server. 

The host character doesn't migrate, so we recommend storing items or transferring them to a friend first.

## Locating Your Existing SOTF Save Files

To start, we first need to locate your existing save file on your local PC. 

<Steps>
1. Press `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard.
2. Copy and paste this, and then navigate to `{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\Multiplayer` or `\Singleplayer`.
   ```
   %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\
   ```
   
3. Here you will see a folder with random numbers, create a copy of the save folder you want to upload.
</Steps>
   <FileTree>
       - Endnight
         - SonsOfTheForest
           - Saves
             - STEAMID64/
               - Multiplayer
                 - **1922034134** Get this folder
                   - **SaveData.zip**
