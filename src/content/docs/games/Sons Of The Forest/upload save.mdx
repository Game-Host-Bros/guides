In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of uploading an existing world and player save file to your [Sons Of The Forest server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/sons-of-the-forest-server-hosting/).

If you get stuck at any time, Game Host Bros offers free save transfers. Just reach out to a bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr)

You **MUST** convert any single player save to a multiplayer save on your local PC first before uploading it to your server. Doing this means the host doesn't keep their inventory so store your items or give them to a friend first.

## Locating Your Existing SOTF Save Files

To start, we first need to locate your existing save file on your local PC. 

<Steps>
1. Press `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard.
2. Copy and paste this, and then navigate to `{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\SinglePlayer` or `\Multiplayer`.
   ```
   %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\
   ```
   
3. Here you will see a folder with random numbers, create a copy of the save folder you want to upload.
</Steps>
   <FileTree>
       - Endnight
         - SonsOfTheForest
           - Saves
             - STEAMID64/
               - Singleplayer
                 - **1922034134** Get this folder
                   - **SaveData.zip**
    </FileTree>

## Converting Your Single Player Save To A Multiplayer Save.

:::note
If you're migrating a save that is already from a co-op server and found in your Multiplayer folder, you can skip these steps and move on to the next section.

<Steps>
1. After you've completed the above and copied your singleplayer save folder, place a copy into `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\Multiplayer`.

2. To get here, press `Windows Key + R` and enter

   ```
   %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\
   ```
3. Navigate to `{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\Multiplayer` and paste your copied save folder.

   <FileTree>
       - Endnight
         - SonsOfTheForest
           - Saves
             - STEAMID64/ 
               - Multiplayer
                 - **1922034134** Copied from Singleplayer!
                   - **SaveData.zip**             
    </FileTree>
2. Open Sons of the forest and click `Multiplayer > Host Game > Continue > Load Game`, select the world you want and click `Start`.
3. In-game manually save using a Tarp or Tent and then close the game.
4. Copy your newly updated save folder from the `Multiplayer` folder.
</Steps>
