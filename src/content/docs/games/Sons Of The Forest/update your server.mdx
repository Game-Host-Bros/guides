<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Auto Update` toggle and make sure it's set to `on` or 1.
4. Click `Console`
5. Click the `Restart` button. 
</Steps>
The server will now automatically download the update as soon as it starts.
