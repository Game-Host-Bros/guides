By default the Max Players for Sons Of The Forest is `8` which is the games maximum. If you're trying to play with a smaller group of people but don't feel like adding a password, here's how to change max players in SOTF.

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
2. Select `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit `Max Players`.
4. After changing, `Start` your Server.
