Connecting to a BeamMP server is straightforward, whether you're joining a public server from the server browser or a private server via direct connect. This guide will walk you through both methods to ensure you're ready to jump into the action with ease.

## Connecting via Server Browser
The server browser is the easiest way to find and connect to public BeamMP servers. This assumes you've already set your server name.

1. Open the BeamMP launcher and let it start the game.
2. Once the game is loaded, go to the `Multiplayer` menu and select `Server Browser.`
3. Click on the server you wish to join and click `Join` to connect. The game will automatically download any required mods before joining.

If you're having trouble finding a specific server, try using the search bar at the top of the server browser.
