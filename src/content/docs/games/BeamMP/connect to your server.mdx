This guide will walk you through both methods to ensure you're ready to jump into the action with ease.

## Connecting Via Server Browser

The server browser is another way to find and connect to public BeamMP servers. This assumes you've already set your server name.

<Steps>
1. Open the BeamMP launcher and let it start the game.
2. Once the game is loaded, click `More > Multiplayer` and select `Public Servers`
3. Select the server you wish to join and click `Join` to connect. The game will automatically download any required mods before joining.

If you're having trouble finding a specific server, try using the search bar at the top of the server browser.
