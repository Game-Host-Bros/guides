Whether you're looking to explore new terrains or just want a different environment for your players, this guide will walk you through the steps to change the server map on your [BeamMP server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/beammp-server-hosting/) using the Game Host Bros Panel. By following these instructions, you'll be able to quickly switch to any of the stock maps that come with BeamMP or even set a custom map of your choice.

## Using Default Maps
Here is how you can use some of the default maps that come with BeamMP.
<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your BeamMP server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Map` setting and select the map you would like from the dropdown.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

## Uploading Custom Maps
Custom maps are normally provided to you in a .zip format. To use custom maps on your BeamMP server, you'll need to upload them via SFTP. For this example we will be uploading a file called `custom_map.zip` to our server.

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your BeamMP server.
2. Access your server files using [SFTP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/).
3. Upload your `custom_map.zip` to `/Resources/Client/` so players are able to download the map. 
4. After uploading, go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` in the Game Host Bros Panel.
5. Look for `Custom Map Zip File Name` and enter the name of the custom_map.zip you just uploaded.
6. Restart your server to apply the changes.

It should now say in the server console `Successfully loaded custom map from ZIP file`.

</Steps>
This is how your files should look if everything is uploaded correctly.
