Whether you're looking to explore new terrains or just want a different environment for your players, this guide will walk you through the steps to change the server map on your [BeamMP server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/beammp-server-hosting/) using the Game Host Bros Panel. By following these instructions, you'll be able to quickly switch to any of the stock maps that come with BeamMP or even set a custom map of your choice.


## Using Default Maps
Here is how you can use some of the default maps that come with BeamMP.
<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your BeamMP server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Map` setting and enter your desired map filepath.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>
Here is a list of the stock maps that come with BeamMP and their filepath.

| Map Name             | Filepath                                  |

## Uploading Custom Maps
Custom maps are normally provided to you in a .zip format. To use custom maps on your BeamMP server, you'll need to upload them via SFTP in 2 different folders, one folder is for the server, and the other is so the client can download the map. Follow these steps:
<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your BeamMP server.
2. Access your server files using [SFTP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/) and navigate to `/levels/`.
3. Extract your custom_map.zip and upload the folder to `/levels/`. The map should be inside its own folder.
4. Upload your custom_map.zip to `/Resources/Client/` so the client is able to download the map.zip (the same as a mod .zip). 
5. After uploading, go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` in the Game Host Bros Panel.
6. Find the `Map` setting and enter the filepath for your custom map, e.g., `/levels/custom_map/info.json`.
7. Restart your server to apply the changes.
</Steps>
This is how your files should look if everything is uploaded correctly.
