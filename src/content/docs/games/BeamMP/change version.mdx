Sometimes, you might want to switch your BeamMP server to a different version. This could be to:

- Access new features available in a pre-release version.
- Maintain compatibility with specific mods or tracks that require an older version.
- Troubleshoot issues by reverting to a previous stable release.

Here is how you can change your BeamMP server to a specific version:

1. Find the version number you want to switch to from the [BeamMP Server Releases](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/releases), e.g., `v3.5.1`.
2. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your BeamMP server.
3. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
4. Change the `BeamMP Server Version` to your desired version (e.g., `v3.5.1`).
5. Navigate to `Advanced > Reinstall Server`. This will reinstall the server with the specified version without deleting any mods or tracks.
6. Start your server.

You can verify that the server version has changed by checking the version number in the server console.
