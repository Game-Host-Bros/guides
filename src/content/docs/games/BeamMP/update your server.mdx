The BeamMP client and server both get updates at different times, so it's possible to connect to older versions of BeamMP server with a newer BeamMP client. You can see what version BeamMP server you're running in the console when you start your server and compare it with the [latest release here](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/releases).

Here is how you can update your BeamMP server to the latest version.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Go to `Configuration > Advanced`.
3. Click `Reinstall` to run the installation script again (This won't delete any mods).
4. Start your server.
