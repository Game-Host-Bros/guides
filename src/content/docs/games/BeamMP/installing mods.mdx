Adding mods to your [BeamMP server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/beammp-server-hosting/) is a great way to enhance gameplay, introduce new features, and keep your community engaged. This guide will walk you through the steps to easily upload and enable mods on your BeamMP server using the Game Host Bros Panel.

## Before You Start
Here are some things you should know before uploading mods to your server.

- Not all mods will work so we suggest uploading one at a time and testing to make sure everything is ok before adding more.
- Please be aware of the file size of your mods, as this directly relates to how long it will take players to join your server.
- Some mods are very poorly optimized. Most well optimized car mods should be 100 - 200mb in size. If a car mod is larger than this it can cause lag for your players.
- If you upload too many mods at once, BeamMP might crash when it starts. You will need to upload your mods in batches, start the server once, then add more mods. This is a BeamMP bug.

## Uploading Mods to Your Server
To start using mods on your BeamMP server, you need to upload them to the correct directory. Here's how:

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your BeamMP server.
2. In the sidebar go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Upload your mod files (usually `.zip` or `.pc` format) to the `/Resources/Client/` directory on your server. For files larger than 1GB you will need to use [SFTP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/).
   <FileTree>
   - Resources
     - Client
       - R33-Skyline.zip
       - Toyota-supra-mod.zip
   </FileTree>
4. Restart your server to apply the changes.
</Steps>

In the server console you should see the mods loaded like this `[INFO] Loaded 9 Mods`.

## Managing Mod Load Order (Optional)
Some mods are required to be loaded in a specific order. To manage the mod load order, follow these steps:
<Steps>
1. Go to `Files > SFTP` in the Game Host Bros Panel and access the `/Resources/Client/` directory.
2. Rename the mod files to reflect the desired load order, using prefixes like `001_`, `002_`, etc.
   <FileTree>
   - Resources
     - Client
       - 001_R33-Skyline.zip
       - 002_Toyota-supra-mod.zip
   </FileTree>
3. Save the changes and restart your server.
</Steps>
