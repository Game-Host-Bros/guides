Spawning AI Cars on a [BeamMP Server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/beammp-server-hosting/) works a little differently to normal freeroam, here's how you can add AI traffic to your BeamMP server using the Traffic app menu.

## Spawning AI Traffic

:::note
The maximum amount of AI cars you can spawn is determined by the value of [Max Cars Per Player](/games/beammp/max-cars-per-player/), this can be adjusted in our game panel under Configuration > Startup Parameters.

If you have CobaltEssentials installed it **MUST** be configured otherwise it will override this setting with a default value of 1 for normal players.

<Steps>
1. [Connect](/games/beammp/connect-to-your-server/) to your BeamMP server.
2. Press `ESC` and click `UI Apps > Add App`. 
3. Search for `Traffic`, then select the Traffic app.
4. Close the UI Apps menu.
5. Spawn cars using the new Traffic menu on the left-hand side.
</Steps>

There are multiple ways to configure these cars, you can set a speed limit, configure the number of cars that spawn, set their AI Mode to Chase, Flee, Random, Traffic and more. 

Once finished, you can close this menu by navigating to UI Apps once more, selecting Edit Apps, then click the X to close the Traffic Menu.
