Here are some common [BeamMP server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/beammp-server-hosting/) issues you may encounter and how to fix them.

## [WARN] Backend failed to respond to a heartbeat.

This means that your server is unable to be queried by BeamMP, the cause of this is most likely because you don't currently have an AUTH key set for your server, this is required if you want your server to be displayed in the server browser.

- Create an [AUTH key](/games/beammp/authkeys/) for your BeamMP server.

### Server Still Won't Show In Multiplayer Browser

This issue is also caused by the above, your server **Requires** an AUTH key to display in the server browser, and also needs to be set as a Public server, follow these steps to resolve the issue

- Create an [AUTH key](/games/beammp/authkeys/) for your BeamMP server.
- Ensure `Private` is set to `False` in Configuration > Startup Parameters of the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).

If unsuccessful, ensure your AUTH key is correct and that you've restarted your server, otherwise there's nothing to do except wait as BeamMP may be having network issues. You can view our own network status [here](https://status.gamehostbros.com/).

## Stuck On Connecting (Mod Troubleshooting)

If you're having trouble connecting to a server and are stuck on "Connecting" or "Start", in most cases this is caused by an incompatible mod and is especially common right after BeamNG has updated, follow these steps to Deactivate your mods before trying to load into your server:

- Restart your PC/BeamMP
- Open BeamMP
- Go to `Repository > Mods Manager`
- Click `Deactivate all mods`.
- Then only re-enable `MultiplayerBeamMP`.
- Connect to your server.

If this doesn't resolve the issue, temporarily rename the `Resources/Client` folder on your server and then restart, doing this will disable mods on your server, then try connecting to your server without mods, If successful you've confirmed it's a mod related issue. To troubleshoot mods, start by removing/disabling half of the mods on your server and then begin testing. We highly recommend using [SFTP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/) to drag multiple mods in and out of your Client folder to quickly narrow down the issue.
