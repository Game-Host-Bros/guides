At Game Host Bros, we automatically take a backup snapshot of your [Palworld](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) save files every few hours the server is live. This means if there is a failed update or a bug you're able to restore to a previous time. Giving you access to saved data in case something goes wrong.
