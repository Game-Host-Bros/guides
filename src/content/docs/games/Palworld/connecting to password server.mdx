Here is how to connect to a password protected server in Palworld.

# Step 1: Open the 'Community Servers' List
Launch Palworld and navigate to the 'Community Servers' section.

# Step 2: Click on a Password-Protected Server
Select any server from the list that is password-protected. This step is crucial for initiating the workaround.

# Step 3: Enter the Password
After clicking on the password-protected server, you will be prompted to enter a password. However, enter the password of the server you actually want to connect to, not the one you clicked on. 

# Step 4: Click 'OK', then Click 'No'
After entering the correct password, click 'OK'. Palworld will then prompt you with a message asking if you want to join the server. Click 'No'. This step is essential to trigger the workaround.

# Step 5: Enter the IP:PORT
Locate the bottom box, and enter the IP:PORT of the server you want to connect to directly.

# Step 6: Click 'Connect'
Once you've entered the correct IP:PORT, click the 'Connect' button to initiate the connection.

**Important Note:**
It's worth noting that the password you entered in Step 3 is temporarily stored in a data cache until an actual connection attempt is made. This stored password is referenced during the next connection attempt.
