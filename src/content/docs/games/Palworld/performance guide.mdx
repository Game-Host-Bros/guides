Hereâ€™s how to boost server FPS and optimize your [Palworld Server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/). This guide highlights best practices you can adopt as a server owner to ensure your Palworld server runs at peak performance often resulting in a noticeable improvement in most cases.

## Daily Restarts

The first thing you'll want to do is create an automatic daily restart schedule, this serves to keep your resource usage under control while ensuring your server has a fresh load once every 24 hours.

To create a schedule follow [this guide](/getting-started/schedules/).

## Optimize Configuration

There are multiple Palworld server settings that will negatively impact performance, some may only a little, while others have very noticable effects. 

If you're having any Server FPS issues adjust these settings accordingly, these will be the most important settings for performance especially if you're running a community server.
 
These settings are changed in `Configuration > Startup Parameters` of the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).

### Main Settings

| Setting Name | Default Value | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| BuildObjectDeteriorationDamageRate | 1.0 | Increase this to clean up objects more often, this should always be at least **0.1** |
| PalSpawnNumRate | 1.0 | Decrease this to spawn less Pals |
| DropItemMaxNum | 3000 | Decrease this especially if you have increased Drop Rates |
| BaseCampMaxNumInGuild | 4 | Decrease this if there are many guilds |
| ServerReplicatePawnCullDistance | 15000.0 | **Experimental**. Decrease this for better performance, officially "Pal Sync Distance" |
| BaseCampWorkerMaxNum | 15 | Decrease this to lessen load |
| MaxBuildingLimitNum | 0 (Unlimited) | Set a value to limit max bases per player |

### Secondary Performance Settings

| Setting Name | Default Value | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| BaseCampMaxNum | 128 | Decrease this if you're running a popular public server with a lot of bases |
| Auto Save Span | 240 (4 minutes)| Increase this for less frequent auto save CPU spikes |
| bAutoResetGuildNoOnlinePlayers | False | Set to **True** - Enables guild disbanding after the duration specified by AutoResetGuildTimeNoOnlinePlayers |
| AutoResetGuildTimeNoOnlinePlayers | 72.0 | If bAutoResetGuildNoOnlinePlayers is enabled, this the time limit before a guild will be disbanded |

:::note
Heavy building, and high player count servers will always reach a limitation at some point. Even the fastest gaming hardware isn't able to run a Palworld server at 60fps in such cases.
