## Transfer From Another Palworld Server Provider

If you already have a Palworld server with another provider then this is how you migrate your existing save to Game Host Bros.

<Steps>
1. On your previous existing server, navigate to `Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/` and backup the folder with random numbers and letters.
2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Palworld server.
3. Go to `Management > File Manager`
4. Navigate to `Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/` and delete the default save folder.
5. Using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your existing save folder and copy the folder id/name. 
6. Navigate to `Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/GameUserSettings.ini` and look for the line that starts with `DedicatedServerName=`.
7. Replace the id/name with your existing folder name.
8. Start your server.
</Steps>

Here's how it should look when uploaded correctly.

## Transfer From A Palworld Steam Co-op Save

If you've been hosting Palworld on your PC locally, then follow this guide. This is only for Steam users.

1. Press `Windows Key + R` and paste this.

   ```
   %LOCALAPPDATA%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames

2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Palworld server.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you may encounter, and how to resolve them.

### No Map Data

Not having map data means the steps relating to GameUserSettings.ini were overlooked, or this data has been deleted from your local game client, the steps for GameUserSettings.ini are the following:

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Palworld server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Copy the name of your existing save folder uploaded to `Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/`, for example `84B5E2264EC387DEDB43179D666031A1`.
4. Navigate to `Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/GameUserSettings.ini` and look for the line that starts with `DedicatedServerName=`.
5. Replace the id/name with your existing folder name.
6. Start your server.
</Steps>

### Locating Your PC Game Pass Save (Optional)

This is optional, follow these steps if you have multiple saves and don't know which save file to convert using Palworld Save Tools.

<Steps>
1. Load into your world in Palworld.
2. Save and exit Palworld.
3. Press `Windows Key + R` and paste this.

   ```
   %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\PocketpairInc.Palworld_ad4psfrxyesvt\SystemAppData\wgs\
   ```
4. Open the folder with the random numbers, there you'll see even more folders with random names. 
5. Sort by date modified, the most recently modified folder is the correct save file name to convert.
</Steps>

Ensure showing hidden folders is enabled under `View > Show > Hidden Items`.
