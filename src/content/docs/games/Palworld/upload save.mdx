## Transfer From Another Palworld Server Provider
If you already have a Palworld server with another provider then this is how you migrate your existing save to Game Host Bros.
<Steps>
1. On your previous existing server, navigate to `Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/` and backup the folder with random numbers and letters.
2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Palworld server.
3. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
4. Once there navigate to `Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/`.
5. Delete the default save folder.
6. Using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your existing save folder and copy the folder id/name. 
7. Navigate to `Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/GameUserSettings.ini` and look for the line that starts with `DedicatedServerName=`.
8. Replace the id/name with your existing folder name.
9. Start your server.
</Steps>

Here's how it should look when uploaded correctly.

## Transfer From A PC Game Pass Co-op Save

:::caution
If you're moving from a local Co-op save file, the host will have to start fresh. The saved data only applies to the externally connected players.

This guide will likely change based on future updates, the most up-to-date steps can be found here: https://github.com/deafdudecomputers/PalWorldSaveTools/blob/main/README.md

Unlike Steam, migrating PC Game Pass Co-op saves will require additional steps and specific tools to convert your map data so all of your buildings can be loaded, here's the easiest way to do it.

### Required Tools


Install these tools before proceeding, if you're only trying to locate your save and would like us to do this migration for you, you'll only need to install and run XGP Save Extractor to retrieve your save file.

- [XGP Save Extractor](https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor/releases)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Palworld Save Tools](https://github.com/deafdudecomputers/PalWorldSaveTools/releases)

<Steps>

1. Download, extract and run [XGP Save Extractor](https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor/releases).
2. Locate the save you wish to upload, it should look something like this.

    <FileTree>
    
    - palworld_43714616561_2024-09-24_00_29_56
      - **84B5E2264EC387DEDB43179D666031A1**
        - **Level/**
          - **01.sav** Important! This is your level data on XGP.
        - **Players/**
        - **LevelMeta.sav**
        - LocalData.sav This is not required.
        - WorldOptions.sav Delete this.
    </FileTree>
    These next steps will cover renaming 01.sav to Level.sav and then using [Palworld Save Tools](https://github.com/deafdudecomputers/PalWorldSaveTools/releases) to convert your save save so it can be loaded on your server.    

3. Download [Palworld Save Tools](https://github.com/deafdudecomputers/PalWorldSaveTools/releases) and extract the contents.
4. Place your `01.sav` file into the `PalWorldSave` folder inside Palworld Save Tools.
5. In the the Save Tools main folder open `PalWorldSaveToolsMenu`, choose `1` Convert Level.sav file to Level.json.
6. Once completed press any key, then choose `2` Convert Level.json file back to Level.sav.
7. Delete the `Level` folder in your save files and then drag your newly converted Level.sav in.
8. Using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your existing save folder to `Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/` and copy the folder id/name.
9. Navigate to `Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/GameUserSettings.ini` and look for the line that starts with `DedicatedServerName=`.
10. Replace the id/name with your existing folder name.
11. Start your server.
    
    This is what your server files should now look like.

              - **LevelMeta.sav**
              - **Players/**
