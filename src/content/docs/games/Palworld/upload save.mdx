In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of uploading an existing save file to your Palworld dedicated server.

If you get stuck at any time, Game Host Bros offers free world transfers. Just reach out to a bro on [Discord)](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr)

:::caution
If you're moving from a local Co-op save file, the host will have to start fresh. The saved data only applies to the externally connected players.
:::
:::danger
You CANNOT transfer a Windows server save file onto our Linux servers. Your character saves will not work. Co-op save files are fine but you will have the issue listed above. 
:::

1. Go to `Appdata\Local\PAL\Saved\SaveGames` on your local computer and backup the file (You may need to allow hidden folders under (View))
2. Login to the Game Host Bros panel and stop your Palworld server.
3. In the Game Host Bros panel go to `Managment > File Manager`
4. Once there navigate to `PAL/Save/Savegame/0`
5. You will see a folder with a random number like 723687123871537817253, you need to copy your existing world into that folder.

Please note: To change these files correctly you must use a FTP program, such as FileZilla. 

The required filezilla server information can be found under STFP details.
