In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of uploading an existing world and player save file to your Palworld dedicated server.

You may also refer to this guide on how to [upload files to your game server.](/getting-started/uploading-files/)

If you get stuck at any time, Game Host Bros offers free world transfers. Just reach out to a bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr)

:::caution
If you're moving from a local Co-op save file, the host will have to start fresh. The saved data only applies to the externally connected players.

:::danger
You cannot transfer Xbox saves from the cloud to a dedicated server.

## Transfer from another Palworld dedicated server

1. On your existing server, navigate to `PAL/Save/Savegame/0` and backup the folder with random numbers and letters.
2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Palworld server.
3. In the sidebar go to `Management > File Manager`.
4. Once there navigate to `PAL/Save/Savegames/0`.
5. Delete the default save folder (It should have a random number like this 723687123871537817243).
6. Upload your existing folder and take note of the folder id/name. 
7. Navigate to `Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/GameUserSettings.ini` and look for the line that starts with `DedicatedServerName=`
8. Replace the id/name with your existing folder name.
9. Start your server.

:::caution
If you have a WorldOptions.sav file in `PAL/Save/Savegames/0`, you must delete it or configure it to use our server settings (We do not recommend this. If you misconfigure this file you will not be able to access your server). You can [configure it here.](/games/palworld/configure-palworld/)
