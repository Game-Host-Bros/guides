This guide is currently obsolete due to the release of the Palworld crossplay update.

Palworld servers now support the following platforms by default:
- Steam
- Xbox (Xbox Console & Xbox/PC Game Pass)
- Mac
:::

A default Palworld server is for the Steam version of the game, if you're hosting a different platform such as Xbox and would like to edit your [Palworld server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) to instead play on a different platform, follow these simple steps.
