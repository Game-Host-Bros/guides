A default Palworld server is for the Steam version of the game, if you're hosting a different platform such as Xbox and would like to edit your [Palworld server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) to instead play on a different platform, follow these simple steps.

:::danger
Palworld doesn't currently support crossplay between different platforms.

It's also possible that changing server platform could break your world, to avoid this you MUST make a [Backup](/getting-started/backups/) of your server.
