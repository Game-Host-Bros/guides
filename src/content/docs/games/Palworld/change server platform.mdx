A default Palworld server is for the Steam version of the game, if you're hosting a different platform such as Xbox and would like to edit your [Palworld server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) to instead play on a different platform, follow these simple steps.

Palworld doesn't currently support crossplay between different platforms.

Palworld currently supports the following:
- Steam (Steam Players Only)
- Xbox (Xbox Console & Xbox/PC Game Pass Players Only)
