At Game Host Bros, we make it easy for you to mod your Palworld server by installing UE4SS automatically. This means you can install plugins and mods from sites like [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/). In addition to this, we also have a few of the most popular mods added directly to our 1 click mod installer.

Some plugins require additional configuration, so please check the URL provided with the mod for more information.

## Installing Mods Manually

1. Download the mods you want from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/). (Make sure they're server side mods!)
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file on your PC.
2. Access your Palworld server using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/).
4. Navigate to `Pal/Binaries/Win64` and upload your extracted plugin folder.
6. Start your server.

`Pal/Binaries/Win64` is the most common folder for mods, however some Palworld mods may require a different location. Please check the documentation for the plugins you're downloading. If you're unsure or get stuck at any time, just reach out to a bro on [Discord)](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr) or via a support ticket.
