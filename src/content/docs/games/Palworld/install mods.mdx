If you're looking to mod your [Palworld server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/), here's how to do it. This guide covers installation for most .pak, .lua and UE4SS mods. You can find plugins and mods from sites like [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/).

:::danger
Always back up your world manually before installing any Mods!

Palworld mod websites mix in client mods with server mods, so you need to make sure they're going to work on a server. You must read the description of each mod as they will tell you if it will work on a server there. 

Here are some things to consider **before** installing mods.

- Make sure they're compatible with servers (UE4SS mods, .pak or .lua). Client servers are **NOT** the same as servers.

- Only install one mod at a time and test it to make sure it works. If it doesn't then remove the files from your server.

- Make sure the mod is compatible with the correct server version (type `info` into the console to get your version).

- Some mods are required to be installed on the **SERVER** and **CLIENT**. This means you would need the mod installed locally on all your players games (including [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS)) as well as the server itself. Refer to the mod documentation.

## Installing UE4SS

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
2. Go to `Tools > Mod Manager`.
3. Install `UE4SS`.
4. `Start` your server.
</Steps>

## Installing Mods

<Steps>
1. Download the mods you want from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/). (Make sure they're server side mods!)
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file on your PC.
2. Access your Palworld server using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/).
4. Upload your extracted mod folder to the location as specified by the Mod author.
   - Our installer version of UE4SS uses `Pal/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/Mods`. Whereas for pak mods `Pal/Content/Paks/LogicMods` or `Pal/Content/Paks/~mods`, again refer to the mods documentation.
6. Start your server.
</Steps>

:::danger
`Pal/Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/Mods` and `Pal/Content/Paks/~mods` are the most common folders, however some Palworld mods may require a different location. Please check the documentation for the plugins you're downloading.

### Lua Mod Installation Example

Lua mods are mods that come in folders and contain the following file structure:

<FileTree>
 - Pal
   - Binaries
     - Win64
       - ue4ss
         - Mods
           - **UploadedMod**
             - **scripts**
               - **main.lua**
</FileTree>

For advanced Lua modding information consider reading this resource:

- [Lua Modding Documentation](https://pwmodding.wiki/docs/category/lua-modding)

### Pak Mod Installation Example

<FileTree>
 - Pal
   - Content
     - Paks
       - **~Mods**
         - **UploadedMod.pak**
</FileTree>

:::note
Always follow the mod authors instructions, if a .pak mod says it needs to be installed into the `LogicMods` folder, place it there instead. ~mods is a folder made to keep your mods organized.
