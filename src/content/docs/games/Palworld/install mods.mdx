At Game Host Bros, we make it easy for you to mod your [Palworld server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) by installing UE4SS automatically. This means you can install plugins and mods from sites like [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/).

Always back up your world manually before installing any Mods!

## Installing Mods 

Palworld mod websites mix in client mods with server mods, so you need to make sure they're going to work on a server. You must read the description of each mod as they will tell you if it will work on a server there. 

Here are some things to consider **before** installing mods.
- Make sure they're compatible with servers (UE4SS mods, .pak or .lua). Client servers are **NOT** the same as servers.
- Only install one mod at a time and test it to make sure it works. If it doesn't then remove the files from your server.
- Make sure the mod is compatible with the correct server version (type `info` into the console to get your version).
- Some mods are required to be installed on the **SERVER** and **CLIENT**. This means you would need the mod installed locally on all your players games (including [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS)) as well as the server itself. Refer to the mod documentation.
<Steps>
1. Download the mods you want from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/). (Make sure they're server side mods!)
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file on your PC.
2. Access your Palworld server using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/).
4. Navigate to `Pal/Binaries/Win64` and upload your extracted plugin folder.
6. Start your server.
</Steps>

Many mods will also need to be enabled in the `Pal/Binaries/Win64/Mods/mods.txt` file, you'll need to add the name of the mod and enable it on a new line.

`Pal/Binaries/Win64` is the most common folder for mods, however some Palworld mods may require a different location. Please check the documentation for the plugins you're downloading.
