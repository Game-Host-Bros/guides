If you're looking to mod your [Palworld server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/), here's how to do it. This guide covers installation for most .pak, .lua and UE4SS mods. You can find plugins and mods from sites like [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/).

Always back up your world manually before installing any Mods!

## Installing Mods 

Palworld mod websites mix in client mods with server mods, so you need to make sure they're going to work on a server. You must read the description of each mod as they will tell you if it will work on a server there. 

Here are some things to consider **before** installing mods.
- If required, make sure to install [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases) before starting, making sure to place UE4SS contents in the matching directories on your server.
- Make sure they're compatible with servers (UE4SS mods, .pak or .lua). Client servers are **NOT** the same as servers.
- Only install one mod at a time and test it to make sure it works. If it doesn't then remove the files from your server.
- Make sure the mod is compatible with the correct server version (type `info` into the console to get your version).
- Some mods are required to be installed on the **SERVER** and **CLIENT**. This means you would need the mod installed locally on all your players games (including [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS)) as well as the server itself. Refer to the mod documentation.
<Steps>
1. Download the mods you want from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/). (Make sure they're server side mods!)
2. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file on your PC.
2. Access your Palworld server using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/).
4. Navigate to `Pal/Binaries/Win64` and upload your extracted plugin folder.
   - There are other locations too, consult the mod/plugin documentation, common locations are `Pal/Binaries/Win64` and `Pal/Binaries/Win64/Mods`. Whereas for pak mods `Pal/Content/Paks/LogicMods`, `Pal/Content/Paks` or `Pal/Content/Paks/~mods`, again refer to the mods documentation.
6. Start your server.
</Steps>

Some mods will also need to be enabled in the `Pal/Binaries/Win64/Mods/mods.txt` file, you'll need to add the name of the mod and enable it on a new line.

`Pal/Binaries/Win64` and `Pal/Binaries/Win64/Mods` are the most common folders, however some Palworld mods may require a different location. Please check the documentation for the plugins you're downloading.
