Here is how to enable Auto Pause on your Game Host Bros [Palworld Server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/), Our Auto Pausing feature is perfect for private servers. This guide covers enabling Auto Pause When Empty on your Palworld server, and why you might want to use this setting:

**Why you might enable Auto Pause**

- Improved server performance as Palworld will begin to slow down if your server hasn't been restarted.
- Pauses Base Decay, Pal Hunger and more.
- You want your server to be private (Requires an [IP address](/games/palworld/connect-to-your-server/) to connect).

## Enabling Auto Pause

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Palworld Server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Enable `Auto Pause When Empty`.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

:::note
Auto Pause isn't compatible with Xbox Palworld servers, furthermore if enabled you **MUST** connect to your server directly by using it's IP address, following [this guide](/games/palworld/connect-to-your-server/).
