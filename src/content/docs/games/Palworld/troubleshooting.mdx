Here are common [Palworld server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) issues and how to fix them.

### Error! app '2394010' state is 0x6 after update job.

Sometimes when you try to update your Palworld server, it will get stuck somewhere with the error `Error! app '2394010' state is 0x6 after update job.`. 

To fix this simply stop your server, navigate to `Tools > Mod Manager` and then install the `Stuck Update Fix Script`. Once you start your server again it should download the update. 

Alternatively, you can go to the file manager and delete the `steamapps` folder, then restart your server.

### "Connection timed out" When Connecting to your Palworld Server

If you're getting the message `Connection timed out` when you're connecting to your server, this is most likely because you're trying to connect via the `Recent Servers` tab. Currently, this may have issues, and you must connect direct [using the IP address every time.](/games/palworld/connect-to-your-server/).

This can also be caused if someone in your guild leaves while other players who were connected to the server are offline. This sometimes can be fixed if they rejoin the guild again otherwise you will need to restart your world.

### Connecting anonymously to Steam Public...Retrying

The `Retrying` issue is caused by Steam connectivity issues. Due to the popularity of Palworld, this is a common issue. To bypass this go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` and disable `Automatic Updates`.

You will also have trouble connecting to your server while Steam has outages. You will sometimes need to wait 5 - 10 minutes to get back in. Steam performances routine maintenance on Tuesdays.
