By default, Game Host Bros Palworld servers will automatically update when the server is restarted, so you shouldn't need to change anything below. If your server didn't update, you can check automatic updates are turned on. This is how you can update your server after a Palworld update. 

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Auto Update` toggle and make sure it's set to `1`.
4. Click `Console`
5. Click the `Restart` button. 

The server will now automatically download the update as soon as it starts.

## My Server Still Didnt Update

If you've tried to restart your server and it didnt update, its possible something is stuck somewhere (`Update state (0x1) running, progress: 0.00 (0 / 0)` for example). To fix this simply stop your server, navigate to `Management > File Manager` and then delete the `steamapps` folder. Once you start your server back up it should download the update fine. 

## Updating From A Reverted Patch

This is what you need to do in order to update your server if it used a rollback patch, reinstalling won't harm your save files at all, but if you're unsure you can go to `Management > Backups`, to create an entire save file backup.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Stop your server.
3. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
4. Find the `Auto Update` toggle and make sure it's set to `1`.
5. Go to `Configuration > Advanced`.
6. Click `Reinstall Server`.
7. Start your server.

Remember if you get stuck at any time then reach out to a bro!
