By default, Game Host Bros Palworld servers will automatically update when the server is restarted. This is how you can update your server after a Palworld update. 


1. Backup your server otherwise **you will** lose your world. (This is a game bug)
2. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
3. Click on your Palworld server.
4. From the console, click the Restart button. 

## My Palworld Server Isn't Updating

If for some reason you can't connect to your Palworld server after an update, your Auto Updates may be disabled. This is how you can check and re-enable the updates for your server. 

1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your server.
3. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
4. Find the `Auto Update` setting and change the value to `1`.
5. Restart your server.
