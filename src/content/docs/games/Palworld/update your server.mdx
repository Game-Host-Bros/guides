By default, Game Host Bros [Palworld servers](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) will automatically update whenever a new update releases ensuring you're server is up-to-date in a seamless manner, automatic updates can also be disabled if you want full control over when your server updates. This is how you can update your server after a Palworld update. 

## Updating Your Palworld Server

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Automatic Updates` toggle and make sure it's enabled.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

Whenever a new update is detected your server will now automatically restart to perform the update.

Ensure Automatic Updates is enabled in Configuration > Startup Parameters and then manually restart your server to forcefully check for an update, if your server still won't update go to `Management > File Manager` and delete the `steamapps` folder, then restart your server.

If you've done all the above then [reach out to a bro on Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr) or via a [Support Ticket](http://portal.gamehostbros.com/). We will help you get your server back up and running asap.
