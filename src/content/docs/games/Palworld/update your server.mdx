By default, Game Host Bros Palworld servers will automatically update when the server is restarted. This is how you can update your server after a Palworld update. 

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Auto Update` toggle and make sure it's set to `on`.
4. Click `Console`
5. Click the `Restart` button. 

The server will now automatically download the update as soon as it starts.
