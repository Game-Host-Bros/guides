By default, Max Players will be set to 32 which is the maximum for [Palworld](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/). If you're looking to lower the amount of people on your server without setting a password, here's how to do it.
<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
2. Select `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit `Max Players`.
4. After changing, `Start` your Server.
</Steps>
