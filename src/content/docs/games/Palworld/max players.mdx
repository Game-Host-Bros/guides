By default Max Players will be set to 32, which is the limit for Palworld. If you're looking to lower the amount of people on your server without setting a password, here's how to do it.

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
2. Select `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit `Max Players`.
4. After changing, `Start` your Server.
