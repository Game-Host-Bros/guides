This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and manage your Palworld server using RCON. This guide also assume you've already set up your [Palworldsettings.ini file](/games/palworld/configure-palworld/)

:::caution
By default, we don't allocate you an extra port for Palworld RCON. Simply contact support, and we will add this to your server for you.

## Enabling RCON

To enable RCON on your Palworld server, follow these steps. 

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Once on your Palworld Service, ensure you stop it before proceeding.
3. Once stopped, on the left, navigate to `Management` then `File Manager`.
4. Inside the File Manager, open the file `/Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/PalWorldSettings.ini`.
5. Edit these values

RCONPort=255575
RCONEnabled=True
AdminPassword="yourpasswordhere"

6. Start your server. 

Make sure the RCON port is the port we provided you.
