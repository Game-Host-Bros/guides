Game Host Bros [Palworld servers](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) have RCON enabled by default, however for security reasons you're restricted to using the web console directly. If you require external access, then contact support and we will open external access for you.


## Changing Your Palworld RCON Password

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Navigate to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Under `Basic` edit `Admin Password` with the password you want to set.
4. Start your server. 
</Steps>
