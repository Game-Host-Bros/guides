Here is how you can join your [Palworld Server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/) using the IP address.

## PC Palworld Server 
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Palworld Server.
2. Copy the [server IP address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap7DtDF-wYg) from the sidebar.
3. Open Palworld and click `Join Multiplayer Game`.
4. At the bottom of the screen you will see `127.0.0.1:8211`, replace this with your IP address and click `Connect`.
</Steps>

## Xbox Palworld Server
<Steps>
1. Set a unique server name in the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) in `Configuration > Startup Parameters` using [this guide](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/palworld/change-server-name/)
2. Select `Join Multiplayer Game` in the Palworld menu.
3. Select `Community Servers`.
4. Check the box "Display servers with different versions".
5. Search your Servers name in the box located at the top.
6. Once found, select your server to connect.
</Steps>
The **Palworld server browser is buggy**, you must have "Display servers with different versions" ticked and it may take a couple of minutes for your server to show up. If it doesn't show up at all then follow these steps in this order. **Test after each step**.

- Restart your server and wait 60 seconds.
- Turn on Display servers with different versions.
- Change your server name to something simple.
- Double check you're on the Community Servers tab.
- Restart your game.

If you're still having trouble then please reach out to Game Host Bros support.

You can also connect by searching for your [server IP address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap7DtDF-wYg) rather than the server name.
