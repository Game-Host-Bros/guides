</Steps>
## How to Connect to Your Xbox Palworld Server
<Steps>
1. Set a unique server name in the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) using [this guide](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/palworld/change-server-name/)
2. Select `Join Multiplayer Game` in the Palworld menu.

</Steps>
The **Palworld server browser is buggy**, and it may take a couple of minutes for your server to show up. If it doesn't show up at all then follow these steps in this order. **Test after each step**.

- Restart your server and wait 60 seconds.
- Change your server name to something simple.
- Double check you're on the Community Servers tab.
- Restart your game.

If you're still having trouble then please reach out to Game Host Bros support.

You can also connect by searching for your [server IP address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap7DtDF-wYg) rather than the server name.
