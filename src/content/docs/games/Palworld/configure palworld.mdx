Here's how you can locate the and edit the config file for your Palworld server. By default, we create this configuration file for you.

:::danger
Your server MUST be stopped before making changes to this file otherwise they won't save. Anything you edit in `Configuration > Startup Parameters` will override what is set in your config.

## Editing PalWorldSettings.ini
Editing your PalWorldSettings.ini file is the fastest way to modify basic settings on your Palworld server.

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Palworld server.
2. Stop your Palworld server.
3. Once stopped, on the sidebar, navigate to `Management > File Manager`.
4. Navigate to `/Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/PalWorldSettings.ini`.
5. After you have made the changes you want, start the server.

## Editing WorldOptions.sav (Advanced)

:::danger
Using this file will allow you to modify everything, but it will overwrite anything inside PalWorldSettings.ini. This also means if you change the server settings in our panel it will no longer work and you **MUST** update them though WorldOptions.sav.

You also must fill out all the options such as IP, Port, RCON, password etc. correctly otherwise your server will not be discoverable/joinable.

If you're using an **Xbox** server you cannot use this file.
:::

1. Generate a `WorldOptions.sav` file using the settings you want from [here](https://palworldoptions.com/) (We suggest importing your PalWorldSettings.ini file).
2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and once there, select your Palworld Service.
3. Once on your Palworld Service, ensure you stop it before proceeding.
4. Once stopped, on the left, navigate to `Management` then `File Manager`.
5. Navigate to `Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/YOURWORLDFILE` and drag the `WorldOptions.sav` into the save folder with your `LevelMeta.sav` and `Level.sav`.
6. After you have uploaded the file, start the server.
