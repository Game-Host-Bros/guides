Here's how you can locate the and edit the config file for your [Palworld server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/palworld-server-hosting/). By default, we create this configuration file for you.

## How To Change Settings On Palworld
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Change the settings you want.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>
## Editing PalWorldSettings.ini

:::danger
You can only edit this file if you don't have all the settings in `Configuration > Startup Parameters`. Your server MUST be stopped before making changes to this file otherwise they won't save. Anything you edit in `Configuration > Startup Parameters` will override what is set in your config.
:::
<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Palworld server.
2. Once stopped, on the sidebar, navigate to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Navigate to `/Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/PalWorldSettings.ini`.
4. After you have made the changes you want, start the server.

## Importing WorldOptions.sav Settings

:::danger
As of the 2nd of December, 2024, we no longer support using WorldOptions.sav on our servers. If you upload this file it will be renamed to `WorldOptions.sav.disabled`. This file is not longer supported for Xbox, and every setting is directly in the panel now so it simply causes issues using if not configured correctly.
:::

1. Click [here](https://palworldoptions.com/) and import your `WorldOptions.sav` file.
2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and once there, select your Palworld Service.
3. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` and change the settings to match your WorldOptions.sav file.
4. Restart your server.
