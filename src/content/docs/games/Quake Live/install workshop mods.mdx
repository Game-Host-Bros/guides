Since [Quake Live](https://www.gamehostbros.com/quake-live-server-hosting/) doesn't support FastDL, you are required to use the Steam Workshop for downloading custom content. The benefit of this is your server and players will always have the same content.

For this example, we will be adding this killstreak sound mod to our server: [Workshop Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701783942)
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Quake Live server.
2. Make sure MinQLX is enabled on your server using [this guide](quake-live/install-plugins/)
3. In the sidebar click on `Management > File Manager`.
4. Select the `baseq3` folder.
5. Open the `workshop.txt` file and add your workshop IDs to the bottom of the file. This downloads the mods to the server itself.
6. Open `server.cfg` and add the line `set qlx_workshopReferences 701783942` to the bottom of the file (replace the ID with your own). This forces the client to download the workshop mods.
7. Restart your server.
</Steps>

If you want to add multiple workshop mods, you **MUST** add all the IDs to the workshop.txt file (one ID each line) and to the server.cfg `qlx_workshopReferences` line (comma separated)
