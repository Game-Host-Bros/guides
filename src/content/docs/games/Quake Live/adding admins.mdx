Managing player permissions—including granting administrative privileges or banning players—is essential for maintaining a healthy gaming environment. [Quake Live](https://www.gamehostbros.com/quake-live-server-hosting/) uses a file called `access.txt` to handle player permissions.

## Setting Yourself As An Admin In Quake Live

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Quake Live server.
2. In the sidebar click on `Management > File Manager`.
3. Select the `baseq3` folder.
4. Find the file named `access.txt`.
5. Add a new entry on its own line and follow the format: `steamid|(mod|admin|ban)` For example: `76561198072786081|ban`.
6. Type `/reload_access` to make the changes live.
