Managing player permissions—including granting administrative privileges or banning players—is essential for maintaining a healthy gaming environment. Quake Live uses a file called `access.txt` to handle player permissions.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your Quake Live server.
3. In the sidebar click on `Management > File Manager`.
4. Select the `baseq3` folder.
5. Here, find the file named `access.txt`.
6. Add a new entry on its own line and follow the format: `steamid|(mod|admin|ban)` For example: `76561198072786081|ban`.
7. Type `/reload_access` to make the changes live.
