In this guide, you will learn how to install mods and plugins on your Valheim server using BepInEx.

:::tip
Some mods need to be installed on your local game client too. We suggest using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ebkr/r2modman/) to toggle your mods and BepInEx on and off.

## How to update BepInEx

To update BepInEx, simply follow the above process again but click Uninstall and then Install again. This will install a fresh copy of BepInEx and update it.

## Installing Plugins
Once BepInEx is installed, you can now add the plugins you wish. We suggest downloading them from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/). You will also need to know how to [upload files to your game server.](/getting-started/uploading-files/).

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Valheim server.
2. Download the plugin you want from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/), right click and extract it.
3. Access your Valheim server using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/).
4. Navigate to `BepInEx/plugins` and upload your extracted plugin folder.
6. Start your server.
