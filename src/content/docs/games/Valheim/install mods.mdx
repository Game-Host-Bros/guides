## Installing Plugins
Once BepInEx is installed, you can now add the plugins you wish. We suggest downloading them from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/). You will also need to know how to [upload files to your game server.](/getting-started/uploading-files/).

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Valheim server.
2. Download the plugin you want from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/), right click and extract it.
3. Access your Valheim server using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/).
4. Navigate to `BepInEx/plugins` and upload your extracted plugin folder.
6. Start your server.

If you get stuck at any time, just reach out to a bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr) or via a support ticket.
