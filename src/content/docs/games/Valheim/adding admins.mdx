## Becoming An Admin

Managing player permissions—including granting administrative privileges or banning players—is essential for maintaining a healthy gaming environment. Valheim uses a file called `adminlist.txt` to handle player permissions.
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Valheim server.
2. In the sidebar click on `Management > File Manager`.
3. Select the `.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/` folder.
4. Here, find the file named `adminlist.txt`.
5. Add a new entry on its own line in SteamID64 format. You can get your SteamID from [here](https://steamid.io/). It should look like this: `76561198072786081`.
6. Restart your server.
