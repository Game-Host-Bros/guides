## Finding Your Save Files

Worlds aren't found in the game files, they are found in a different location which can be accessed by doing this.
<Steps>
1. Press `Win + R`.
2. Go to this file path 
   ```
   %userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\worlds
   ```
3. Copy your worlds `.fwl` and `.db` files.

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Valheim server.
2. Access your Valheim server using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/).

4. Back in the panel, go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
5. Edit `World Name` and change it to the name of your world file.
