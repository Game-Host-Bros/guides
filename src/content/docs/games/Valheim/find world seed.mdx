Here's a simple guide to retrieve the world seed for your [Valheim server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/valheim-server-hosting/) using console commands. World seeds allow you to explore your map on external websites, or can be used to generate new copies of your world in singleplayer.

## Enabling Console

The Valheim in-game console is disabled by default, here are the steps to enable console if you wish to use commands while playing on your server.

<Steps>
1. Open Steam.
2. Navigate to `Library`.
3. `Right-click` Valheim and enter properties.
4. Type `-console` in launch options.
5. Close the window and start your game.
</Steps>

## Finding Your World Seed

<Steps>
1. [Connect](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/valheim/connect-to-your-server/) to your Valheim Server.
2. Press `f5` to open Console.
3. Type `printseeds` to print your world seed. 
</Steps>

:::tip
After running the `printseeds` command, you'll see an output that looks something like this:

- -925266684/MXADgi5IxT

Your world seed is the code after the /, in this example the world seed is `MXADgi5IxT`.
