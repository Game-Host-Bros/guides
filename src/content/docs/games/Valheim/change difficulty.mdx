## Resetting World Modifiers

If you'd like to change existing World Modifiers you may need to follow these steps, here's how it's done. 

We always recommend making a [Backup](/getting-started/backups/) before making any major changes.

<Steps>
1. Enable console, then connect to your server as an Admin following our [Valheim Admin Guide](/games/valheim/adding-admins/)
2. Open console with `f5`.
3. Type `devcommands`.
   - You should see devcommands = true.
4. Enter these commands, `setworldpreset default` and then `save`.
</Steps>

:::tip
Press f1 and you'll now see that your World Modifiers have been cleared.
:::

- `setworldpreset default` will clear your existing world modifiers, `save` will initiate a save of your server. 

Once done, refer to the above steps [here](/games/valheim/change-difficulty/#changing-world-modifiers) to set new World Modifiers.
