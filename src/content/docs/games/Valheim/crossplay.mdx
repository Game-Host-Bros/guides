In this guide you will learn how to enable Crossplay on your [Valheim server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/valheim-server-hosting/). This will allow you to play with players on Microsoft Game Pass, Xbox, and Epic players.

:::danger
Enabling this option will route all traffic through Microsoft's servers meaning you will have increased latency/ping. You also cannot disable Crossplay after it is enabled otherwise you will no longer be able to connect to your server. Please reach out to Game Host Bros staff to resolve this if you have accidentally enabled it.
:::
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click `Startup Parameters`.
3. Look for `Crossplay` and then change the value to `1`.
4. Go back to the console page, then restart your server.
