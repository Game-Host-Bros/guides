:::tip
Did you know? As an alternative method:

You can select the `Mod Preset` icon in the Arma Reforger main menu, then select the `JSON` tab, click `Copy to clipboard` to quickly copy the data of your locally installed mods.

We recommend sorting and editing this list, especially if there are a lot of mods included.
