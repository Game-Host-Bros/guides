Here is how to upload existing saves to your Ark Survival Evolved Server.

## How To Find Your Existing Ark Survival Evolved Saves

First you'll need to locate your existing world, follow these steps to do this.

1. Open Steam and navigate to your `Library`.
2. Right-Click Ark Survival Evolved and hover `Manage > Browse Local Files`.
3. Navigate to `ShooterGame\Saved\SavedArksLocal`.
4. Find the `.arktribe` `.arkprofile` and `TheIsland.ark` files.

:::tip
If you want to upload your settings aswell, they'll be located in `ShooterGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`. You'll need to copy `Game.ini` and `GameUserSettings.ini`
:::

Note that `.arkprofile` will need to be renamed from `LocalPlayer.arkprofile`, you'll have to change this to [YourSteamID64.arkprofile].

## How To Upload Your Existing Ark Survival Evolved Saves

There are two methods to do this, you can either use our `Management > File Manager` or `SFTP`, we cover both methods [here](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/).

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/)
2. Click `System > Console` and `Stop` your server.
2. Find your SFTP details under `System > SFTP Details` and connect to your server via `SFTP`.
3. After connecting to your server, navigate to `/ShooterGame/Saved/SavedArks`.
4. As you're uploading existing saves, you can go ahead and `Delete` everything in there.
5. Select the `.arktribe` `.arkprofile` and `TheIsland.ark` files. And upload them to `/ShooterGame/Saved/SavedArks`.
6. Rename `LocalPlayer.arkprofile` to [YourSteamID64.arkprofile] for example it should now be `76561198106341655.arkprofile`.
7. Start your server.

:::tip
If you're uploading a different `Map`, make sure `Server Map` is set correctly in `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
