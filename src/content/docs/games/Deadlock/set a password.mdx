This is what you do if you need to set a password on your Deadlock server.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and open your Deadlock server.
2. Click `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Look for `Server Password` and then type the password you want.
4. Go back to the console page, then restart your server.

In-game clients must open the console by pressing `F7` and then type `password yourpassword` before they can connect to the server.
