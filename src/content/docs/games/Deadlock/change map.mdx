Here is a list of the stock maps that come with Deadlock. You can find all the map names by going to `game/citadel/maps` in the File Manager.

| **Map Name**         | **Description**                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `street_test`        | The main multiplayer map                         |
| `new_player_basics`  | The Hero Sandbox map                             |
| `1v1_test`           | Seems like an early, smaller version of street_test |
| `hero_testing`       | Seems like an early Hero Sandbox                 |
