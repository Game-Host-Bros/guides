By default, Game Host Bros has some game presets for different types of game modes in Deadlock. These range from fun with bots to 6v6 competetive configs. If you would prefer to use your own configuration then leave this set to None.
<Steps>
1. Visit [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Deadlock server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Look for Game Preset and change it to your desired mode.
4. Restart your server.
