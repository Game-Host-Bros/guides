As Deadlock is extremely new, we have compiled a list of common errors and fixes.

## Server Isn't Responding

We've noticed that even an idle Deadlock server will crash after some time with no indication that it has stopped. You will need to restart the server to get back into the game. We notice it happens once roughly every 6 hours. You can quickly check if your server has crashed by typing `status` into the console.

Game Host Bros recommends that you restart your server before and after any match played for the best stability. We are working on crash detection and will implement a fix for this soon. You can also use our [Schedules](/getting-started/schedules/) feature to automate the process of Restarting the server.
