Here is a full list of console commands for both your Deadlock server and clients. Please be aware some commands are cheat protected and you will need to use `sv_cheats 1` to allow them.

## Finding Console Commands

You can search through all the commands for Deadlock by going to your server console and typing `find` followed by the description of what you want. Most things to do with Deadlock start with the prefix `citadel_`.

Please remember that the Source engine is used in multiple games so just because a command exists, doesn't mean it will work.
