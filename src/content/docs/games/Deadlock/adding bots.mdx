Follow these steps to add bots on your Deadlock server:

1. Visit [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Deadlock server.
2. Go to `Console`.
3. To load the bot config, enter the following command `exec citadel_botmatch_practice_6v6_hard`. You can replace `hard` with `easy` or `medium` to set the difficulty.

If you're already in a game, run the command `changelevel street_test` to restart the match.
