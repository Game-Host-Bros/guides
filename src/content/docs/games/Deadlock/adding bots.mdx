Follow these steps to add bots on your Deadlock server:

:::note 
There is a bug where all the bots will be in one lane until a guardian in that lane dies.
:::

1. Visit [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Deadlock server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Look for Game Preset and set it to `citadel_botmatch_practice_6v6_hard`. You can replace `hard` with `easy` or `medium` to set the difficulty.
4. Restart your server.
