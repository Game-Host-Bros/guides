This is what you do if you need to change your server name on your NMRIH server, also referred to as a hostname. This is what is displayed to players in the server browser.

2. Select your server.
3. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
4. Find the `Server Name` setting and enter your desired server name.
5. Restart your server.
