By default, Game Host Bros servers are set up to receive RCON connections for controlling your server.

:::caution
Unlike CSGO, **you cannot use RCON from in-game without 3rd party plugins**.
:::

With that said, you can still issue commands to the server by using other methods.

1. Type your commands directly into your game server control from the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/). (Recommended)
2. Using our [Game Panel API](https://gamepanel.notion.site/Client-API-ed28e66a240a4c6886232daf141f81c5). (Recommended)
3. Use an external application on your PC, such as [CS2-RCON-Tool-V2](https://github.com/fpaezf/CS2-RCON-Tool-V2).
4. In-game using a CounterStrikeSharp plugin, such as [CS2Rcon](https://github.com/LordFetznschaedl/CS2Rcon).
