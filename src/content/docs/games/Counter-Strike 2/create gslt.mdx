Here is how you create a GSLT for CS2 and add it to your server. This is required by Valve to be displayed in the server list.

1. Go [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) and login with your Steam account.
2. Under `App ID` enter `730` for CS2, then name the memo anything you want. 
3. Visit [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Counter Strike 2 server.
4. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
5. Enter your token under `Game Server Token` and then restart your server.

:::note
If you have the error `Cert request for invalid failed with reason code 5005.  We're not logged into Steam`, that means your token is invalid and may need to be generated again.
