Here is how you create a GSLT for [CS2](https://www.gamehostbros.com/cs2-server-hosting/) and add it to your server. This is **required** by Valve to be displayed in the server list.
<Steps>
1. Go [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) and login with your Steam account.
2. Under `App ID` enter `730` for CS2, then name the memo anything you want. 
3. Visit [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Counter Strike 2 server.
4. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
5. Enter your token under `Game Server Login Token`. 
6. Click `Console` in the sidebar and then restart your server.
</Steps>
If you have the error `Cert request for invalid failed with reason code 5005.  We're not logged into Steam`, that means your token is invalid and may need to be generated again.

:::note
Each CS2 server you run requires its own GSLT.

<summary>Can I get a GSLT Ban?</summary>

In the past, Valve has token banned server owners that have used plugins that grant users special weapon skins, knifes or ranks. If Valve token bans you, this means you can no longer host servers from your account, and you will be temporarily banned from Competitive mode. **We strongly suggest you view Valves [Terms of Service](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/07AF-502E-A104-BD4B)** to see what is an isn't allowed.

If your GSLT is banned then you will need to use another Steam account to generate tokens in the future.
