## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why isn't my server showing in the server browser?</summary>

Counter-Strike has had a long-running issue with [fake servers](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2540) in the server browser. This is a problem because the server browser itself can only return so many results at once.

What this means is you could be waiting a long time for your server to show up, or it simply may not show at all. Unfortunately this is something that is out of our control. Your favorites are not affected by this issue and should work as intended.
