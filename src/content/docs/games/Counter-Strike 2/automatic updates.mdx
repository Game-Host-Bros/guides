At Game Host Bros, we have true automatic updates for Counter Strike 2. This means as soon as an update comes out, within 120 seconds your server will send a message to all the players on the server and restart it.

:::note
There is no way to interrupt this once it starts. If you're running an important match, then you must disable the updater.
