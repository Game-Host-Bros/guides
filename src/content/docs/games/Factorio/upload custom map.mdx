**Windows:** (Press WIN+R) - `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Factorio\Saves`
**Mac OS:** (Press CMD+Space) - `~/Library/Application Support/factorio/saves`
**Linux:** `~/.factorio/saves`

2. Find the save .zip file you want to upload to your Factorio server and copy it in a safe location.
3. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Factorio server.
4. Go to `Management > File Manager` and then open the `saves` directory.
5. Drag the save .zip file from your folder to the server
6. Navigate to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` and look for save name.
7. Change it to the exact name of your save file.
8. Star your server.
