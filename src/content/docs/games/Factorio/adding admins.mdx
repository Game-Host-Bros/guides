Many of the things you may want to do on your [Factorio server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/factorio-server-hosting/) will require Administrator/OP permissions, luckily it's very easy to become an Admin!

Here is how you can make yourself an admin on your Factorio server.

## Becoming An Admin

<Steps>
  1. Join your Factorio server.
  2. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Factorio server.
  3. Go to `System > Console`.
