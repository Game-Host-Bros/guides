Here are common Factorio issues and how to fix them.

## Modifying Map Settings

A [Factorio server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/factorio-server-hosting/) will start with a default map, regardless of your server settings. If you require a custom seed, you will first need to create it on your PC first and then [upload your save file to your Factorio server.](/games/factorio/upload-custom-map/)

## Players Are Not Showing In The Game Panel

Due to how the Factorio game query works, your server must be publicly listed on the server browser if you want the player count to work. You can find out how to [make your Factorio server public here.](/games/factorio/public-server/) You can also set a password on your server to keep it private but while retaining the player count.
