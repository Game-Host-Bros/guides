In this guide you will learn how to install Factorio mods manually and using the Game Host Bros Mod Manager. You can download mods from [https://mods.factorio.com/](https://mods.factorio.com/).

## Installing Factorio Mods With Our Mod Manager

We already have some popular overhaul mods available on our 1-Click Mod Manager. This is the fastest way to get a modified server up and running.

1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your server.
3. In the left-hand menu, click `Tools > Mod Manager`.
4. Click the Install button for the mod you want then restart the server.

After the mods have been installed on your Factorio server, you can simply connect to your server, and it will prompt you to install the missing mods automatically.

Some mods may say `Something went wrong while trying to perform this action.` when you install them. This can safely be ignored.

## Manually Installing Factorio Mods

If the Factorio mod you want to play isn't listed in our Mod Manager, installing them on your server is quite straight forward.

1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your server.
3. In the left-hand menu, click `Management > File Manager`.
4. Open the `Mods` folder
5. Drag the mods you want to add into this file and restart the server.

Like our 1-Click mods, you can simply join the server afterwards, and it will automatically download them to your game client.

:::caution
Make sure you install All the dependencies the mod requires. This is listed on the mod download page. On [https://mods.factorio.com/](https://mods.factorio.com/) you will find them on the `Downloads` tab under `Dependencies`. They're listed in blue.
