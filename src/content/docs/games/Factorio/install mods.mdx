In this guide you will learn how to install mods to your [Factorio server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/factorio-server-hosting/). You can download mods from [https://mods.factorio.com/](https://mods.factorio.com/).

## Manually Installing Factorio Mods

We have a couple popular overhaul mods in our Mod Manager under `Tools > Mod Manager`, if the Factorio mod you want to play isn't listed in our Mod Manager, installing them on your server is quite straight forward.

<Steps>
1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Factorio server.
2. In the left-hand menu, click `Management > File Manager`.
3. Open the `Mods` folder
4. Drag the mods you want to add into this file and restart the server. (Limited to 1GB, otherwise use [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/)).
   <FileTree>
   
   - mods
     - **mod.zip**
     - **mod2.zip**
     - ..
   </FileTree>
</Steps>
Like our 1-Click mods, you can simply join the server afterwards, and it will automatically download them to your game client.

:::caution
Make sure you install All the dependencies the mod requires. This is listed on the mod download page. On [https://mods.factorio.com/](https://mods.factorio.com/) you will find them on the `Downloads` tab under `Dependencies`. They're listed in green.

## Automatically Updating Factorio Mods

At Game Host Bros we can automatically manage the mods on your server, keeping them up to date when your server first starts. It will update/downgrade your mods depending on the Factorio version you have set. When your server starts you will get a list of what is updated or downgraded. This will only work on mods from the [Factorio Mods Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/)

1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Ensure your `Factorio Account Username` and `Factorio Account Token` are set. You can get them from here: https://www.factorio.com/profile
4. Set `Update Mods` to `Enabled`.
5. Restart your server.
