This is how you can change your Factorio dedicated server version, this is handy if you want to upload an old save that you'd like to continue on our servers, as newer Factorio versions most likely won't be compatible due to recipe changes and more.

## Changing Your Factorio Server Version

We don't recommend using your current save or any mods on a different version of Factorio. However, if you still want to try, you must first manually download a backup of your save before proceeding with the steps below.

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit `Factorio Version`.
   - Disable Space Age Support for pre space age versions.
4. Delete all server files in `Management > File Manager`.
5. Go to `Configuration > Advanced > Reinstall Server` to reinstall your server.
</Steps>


All versions including the latest Factorio versions can be found [here](https://www.factorio.com/download/archive/):
