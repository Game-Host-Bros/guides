In this guide we will show you how you can make your [Factorio server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/factorio-server-hosting/) public, so it shows up in the game server browser.

Having your server public means anyone can come and destroy your factory. Please ensure you have increased your automatic backups, intervals or that you have a password set on your server. This can all be done from `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.

<Steps>
1. Get your Token from the [Factorio.com profile page](https://factorio.com/profile)
2. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and open your Factorio server.
3. Click `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
4. Look for `Factorio Account Token` and `Factorio Account Username`, fill them out with the details from Factorio.com.
5. Go back to the console page, then restart your server.
