## FAQs

<summary>Why are updates not automatic?</summary>

We prioritize the stability of your factory by giving you full control over updates. Factorio worlds and mods can be sensitive to version changes, especially with large or complex builds. By letting you manage updates manually, we ensure that:

- Your megabase remains stable and functional without recipe breaking changes
- Mod compatibility isn't unexpectedly broken
- You can test updates in a controlled environment first
- Your automation systems continue running smoothly

This approach prevents any unwanted surprises that could impact hours of careful planning and construction.
