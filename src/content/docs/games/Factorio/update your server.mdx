At Game Host Bros we have automatic updates for [Factorio servers](https://www.gamehostbros.com/factorio-server-hosting/) by default, this can always be toggled on-off and you'll also be able to [change your server version](/games/factorio/change-version/) if you'd like to use an older version.

## Updating Your Factorio Server

By default a server will install to the `latest` version, keeping your server up-to-date with Factorios current patch, if you're looking to play an older version follow [this guide](/games/factorio/change-version/).

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Enable `Automatic Updates`.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

Your server will now automatically restart to perform an update whenever a new Factorio update is released, the update delay and chat message sent can also be configured to your preferences too.

:::note
Whenever your server performs an automatic update it will create a backup of your save and place it into a `save-backups` folder, along with a version number its being updated from and a timestamp. This is handy in case something goes wrong as your save will be preserved and your server version can always be changed to the previous if necessary.

If you get stuck at any time, you can reach out to a bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr).

<summary>Should I Turn Automatic Updates Off?</summary>

We prioritize the stability of your factory by giving you full control over automatic updates. Factorio worlds and mods can be sensitive to version changes, especially with large or complex builds. By letting you toggle automatic updates and select your version, while also creating a backup of your save before an update occurs, we ensure that:

- Your megabase remains stable and functional without recipe breaking changes
- Mod compatibility isn't unexpectedly broken
- You can test updates in a controlled environment first
- Your automation systems continue running smoothly

This approach prevents any unwanted surprises that could impact hours of careful planning and construction.
