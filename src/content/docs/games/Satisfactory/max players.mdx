Looking to add some more friends to the fun? While many Satisfactory settings are set through the in-game `Server Manager`, that isn't the case for max players, here's how to change it from the game default of four.

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
2. Select `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit `Max Players`.
4. After changing, `Start` your Server.
