Looking to add some more friends to the fun? While many [Satisfactory](https://www.gamehostbros.com/satisfactory-server-hosting/) settings are set through the in-game `Server Manager`, that isn't the case for max players, here's how to change it from the game default of four.

## Setting Max Players For Satisfactory

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
2. Select `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit `Max Players`.
4. After changing, `Start` your Server.
