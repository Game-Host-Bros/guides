In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of downloading your save file from your [Satisfactory server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/satisfactory-server-hosting/). This is handy if you need to use a Satisfactory calculator.

## Downloading Saves

<Steps>
1. Firstly, login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Satisfactory server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Navigate to `.config/Epic/FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames/server` and download the latest auto save file.
</Steps>

:::note
Make sure you're entering the `.config` folder on your server. Not to be confused with FactoryGame as Satisfactory dedicated servers don't store their files in the same location as local game clients.
