If you don't want to play Satisfactory on the latest public version, and would rather play a different beta branch such as experimental to play-test upcoming updates, here's how to change the version of your [Satisfactory server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/satisfactory-server-hosting/). 

:::danger
Make sure you backup your save before changing versions! Features from experimental versions are not expected to be supported on shared hosting as this is only a testing ground for the game developers. **We officially only support the main, public branch of the game.**
