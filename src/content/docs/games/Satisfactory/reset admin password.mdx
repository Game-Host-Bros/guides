If you've forgotten your admin password, or would like to reset server settings to their default values, this guide will walk you through the necessary steps to reset authentication on your [Satisfactory server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/satisfactory-server-hosting/).

## Resetting Your Admin Password

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Satisfactory server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Navigate to `.config/Epic/FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames`
4. Delete `ServerSettings.xxxx.sav`.
5. `Start` your server.
</Steps>

:::note
Make sure you're entering the `.config` folder on your server. Not to be confused with FactoryGame as Satisfactory dedicated servers do not store their files in the same location as local game clients.
