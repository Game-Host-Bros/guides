We get asked a lot if you're able to install mods on a [Satisfactory server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/satisfactory-server-hosting/).

Currently, **you're not able to install Mods on a Satisfactory dedicated server**, only multiplayer sessions hosted from your PC are able to have mods installed.

If Coffee Stain Studios makes modding possible on dedicated servers in the future, Game Host Bros will add support.
