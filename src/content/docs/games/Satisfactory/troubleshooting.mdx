Here are common Satisfactory server issues and how to fix them.

### No EncryptionToken specified, disconnecting.
This message happens when you try and join the server from the `Join Game` menu. You must join your Satisfactory server from the `Server Manager`.

## Tier 0 has been skipped
Currently, Tier 0 (Onboarding) is not possible to play on a dedicated server and it will be automatically unlocked, even if you upload a save in Tier 0. If you would like to play the beginning of the game with Onboarding, it is recommended you play local multiplayer first, and then upload your save to your server after completing Tier 0.

This seems intentional as the onboarding doesn't really make sense for a dedicated server.
