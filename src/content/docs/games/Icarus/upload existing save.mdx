If you haven't already, you need to [Connect to your server](/games/icarus/connect-to-your-server/), then create a new prospect to generate the necessary files on your server.

## Finding Your Save Files

Worlds aren't found in the game files, they are found in a different location which can be accessed by doing this.

<Steps>
1. Press `Windows Key + R`.
2. Enter this: 
   ```
   %LocalAppData%/ICARUS/Saved/PlayerData
   ```
3. Open the folder named after your [SteamID64](https://www.steamidfinder.com/), and then enter `Prospects`.
4. Copy your prospect.json file.
   - For example if your Prospect is named MySave, your save file will be `MySave.json` in the Prospects folder.
