In V Rising, there are 2 methods to configure your server. For basic settings you will edit everything from the Game Panel [Startup Parameters](/getting-started/beginners-guide/#edit-server-settings) screen. The other and more advanced way is to use the ServerGameSettings.json file to configure your [V Rising server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/v-rising-server-hosting/).

## How To Create ServerGameSettings.json

By default, this file is not created automatically. You need to use one of the base game files as a template to generate it or use the example file below.

:::danger
Make sure Game Setting Preset is set to blank/Unknown under Startup Parameters to use a custom ServerGameSettings.json.
:::
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. Go to `System > Console` and Stop your server.
3. Click on `Management > File Manager.`
4. Navigate to `VRisingServer_Data/StreamingAssets/GameSettingPresets` and look for a template that suits your desired settings.
   <FileTree>
    - VRisingServer_Data
      - StreamingAssets
        - **GameSettingPresets/**
   </FileTree>

5. Click the 3 dots on the right-hand side of the file and click `Download`.
6. After you've made your changes, navigate to `/save-data/Settings` and drag your modified file in.
7. Rename it to `ServerGameSettings.json` and restart your server.
   <FileTree>
    - save-data
      - Settings
        - **ServerGameSettings.json**
   </FileTree>

</Steps>


:::danger
Do NOT edit the files directly inside `VRisingServer_Data/StreamingAssets/GameSettingPresets` as they will be overwritten on an update.
