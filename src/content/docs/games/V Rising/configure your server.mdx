In this guide, we will teach you how to configure your [V Rising server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/v-rising-server-hosting/) using both game presets or by using a custom ServerGameSettings.json file.

## Using Game Presets

If you only want to play specific game modes, then game presets is filled with options you can use to quickly get up and running.

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your V Rising server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Game Setting Preset` setting and change it to the desired mode.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

## Setting Custom Settings Using ServerGameSettings.json

We allow you to make custom settings using the `ServerGameSettings.json` file, however **you must** make sure `Game Setting Preset` is set to blank/Unknown under Startup Parameters to use custom settings. If you have a Game Setting Preset set then this file is ignored.

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your V Rising server.
2. Click on `Management > File Manager.`
3. Navigate to `/save-data/Settings/ServerGameSettings.json` and make the changes you want.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

If you need to know what all the settings do, we have a [PDF that you can download here](https://cdn.stunlock.com/docs/vrising/VRising_Server_Game_Settings_1.0.4.79918.pdf). This is released by the game developers that contains all the settings and descriptions.
