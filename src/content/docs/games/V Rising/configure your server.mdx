In V Rising, there are 2 methods to configure your server. For basic settings you will edit everything from the Game Panel [Startup Parameters](/getting-started/beginners-guide/#edit-server-settings) screen. The other more advance way is to use the ServerGameSettings.json file.

## How to create ServerGameSettings.json

By default, this file is not created automatically. You need to use one of the base game files as a template to generate it or use the example file below.

:::danger
Make sure Game Setting Preset is set to blank/Unknown under Startup Parameters to use a custom ServerGameSettings.json.
:::
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your V Rising server.
2. Go to `System > Console` and Stop your server.
3. Click on `Management > File Manager.`
4. Navigate to `VRisingServer_Data/StreamingAssets/GameSettingPresets` and look for a template that suits your desired settings.
5. Click the 3 dots on the right-hand side of the file and click `Download`.
6. After you've made your changes, navigate to `/save-data/Settings` and drag your modified file in.
7. Rename it to `ServerGameSettings.json` and restart your server.
</Steps>

:::danger
Do NOT edit the files directly inside `VRisingServer_Data/StreamingAssets/GameSettingPresets` as they will be overwritten on an update.

## ServerGameSettings.json Example File

Here is an example of ServerGameSettings.json that you can use. It's based on the Standard PVP file.

      "StartHour": 8,
      "EndHour": 2,
      "EndMinute": 0
    },
    "WeekendTime": {
