In V Rising, there are 2 methods to configure your server. For basic settings you will edit everything from the Game Panel [Startup Parameters](/getting-started/beginners-guide/#edit-server-settings) screen. The other more advance way is to use the ServerGameSettings.json file.

## How to create ServerGameSettings.json

By default, this file is not created automatically. You need to use one of the base game files as a template to generate it or use the example file below.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your V Rising server.
3. Go to `System > Console` and Stop your server.
4. Click on `Management > File Manager.`
5. Navigate to `VRisingServer_Data/StreamingAssets/GameSettingPresets` and look for a template that suits your desired settings.
6. Click the 3 dots on the right-hand side of the file and click `Download`.
7. After you've made your changes, navigate to `/save-data/Settings` and drag your modified file in.
8. Rename it to `ServerGameSettings.json` and restart your server.

:::tip[Did you know?]
You have to leave the Game Settings Preset empty in Startup Parameters to use this file.

:::danger
Do NOT edit the files directly inside `VRisingServer_Data/StreamingAssets/GameSettingPresets` as they will be overwritten on an update.
