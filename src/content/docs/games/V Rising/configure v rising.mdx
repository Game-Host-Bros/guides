In V Rising, there are 2 methods to configure your server. For basic settings you will edit everything from the Game Panel [Startup Parameters](/getting-started/beginners-guide/#edit-server-settings) screen. The other more advance way is to use the ServerGameSettings.json file.

## How to Change Game Settings Using ServerGameSettings.json

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your V Rising server.
3. Go to `System > Console` and Stop your server.
4. Click on `Management > File Manager.`
5. Navigate to `save-data/Settings/ServerGameSettings.json`
6. Change the settings you want.
7. Restart your server.
