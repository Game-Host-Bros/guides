## Installing Plugins
Once BepInEx is installed, you can now add the plugins you wish. We suggest downloading them from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/). You will also need to know how to [upload files to your game server.](/getting-started/uploading-files/).

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your V Rising server.
2. Download the plugin you want from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/), right click and extract it.

6. Start your server.
