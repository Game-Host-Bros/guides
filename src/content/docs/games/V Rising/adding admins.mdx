Here is how to add admins to your V Rising server.

Before beginning this guide, you should have the SteamID64 of the user you want to add as an admin/moderator. You can find your SteamID [here](https://steamid.io/).

## Setting Yourself As An Admin In V Rising

1. Log into the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com). 
2. Select your V Rising server and make sure it's stopped.
3. In the sidebar, select `Management > File Manager`.
4. Navigate to `save-data/Settings/adminlist.txt`
5. Enter your SteamID64 and click `Save File`.
6. Click `Console` on the right hand side and start your server.

## Using Admin Commands

1. Open V Rising and connect to your server.
2. Once connected open your options and navigate to `General > Interface > Console Enabled`. Make sure this is enabled.
3. Press the tilde key `~` and type `adminauth`

It should say `You now have Administrator priveleges (SuperAdmin)!`. You can now use any commands you wish for V Rising.
