This is what you do if you need to change your server name on your Counter-Strike Global Offensive server, also referred to as a hostname. This is what is displayed to players in the server browser.

1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your CSGO server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Server Name` setting and enter your desired server name.
4. Restart your server.

This setting will override anything you have manually set inside of server.cfg
