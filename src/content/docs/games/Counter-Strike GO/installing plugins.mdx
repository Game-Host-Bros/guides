Installing plugins on your Counter-Strike: Global Offensive server can enhance gameplay and add new features. **By default, Game Host Bros CSGO servers come with Metamod, Sourcemod preinstalled and configured for use after CS2's release**. We also preconfigure Cleaner to remove any messages about needing to update your server after CS2's launch. 

We suggest you only add a single plugin or extension at a time and ensure it's working before moving onto installing another plugin. Installing lots of plugins at once makes it much harder to troubleshoot what is causing problems.

## How To Install Plugins

1. In the sidebar go to `Management > File Manager`.
2. Navigate to the `csgo/addons/sourcemod/plugins/` directory.
3. Upload your plugin files (usually ending in .smx) to this directory.
4. Restart your server or use the `sm plugins refresh` command in the server console.

To check if your plugins have loaded, you can type `sm plugins list` into the server console and it will print out all the running plugins.

## How To Install Extensions

Some plugins require additional extensions to function properly. Here's how to install them:

1. In the file manager, go to the `csgo/addons/sourcemod/extensions/` directory.
2. Upload the extension files (ending in .so for Linux) to this directory.
3. If the extension came with a .cfg file, upload it to `csgo/cfg/sourcemod/`.
4. Restart your server.

Always make sure you're using extensions compatible with Linux and your SourceMod version.

To check if your extensions have loaded, you can type `sm exts list` into the server console and it will print out all the running extensions.
