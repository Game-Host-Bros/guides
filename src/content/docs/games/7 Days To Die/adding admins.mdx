Looking to better manage your 7 Days To Die server by adding admins? This comprehensive guide will show you how to assign admin privileges to trusted players on your [7D2D server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/).

## How To Add Admins In 7D2D
<Steps>
1. Connect to your 7D2D server.
2. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
3. In the sidebar click on `System > Console` type `listplayers` and note the player ID= of the user you want to set as Admin.
4. Enter this command:

   ```  
   admin add ID 0 Name
   ```
   example
   ```
   admin add 23 0 Pedrotski
   ```
   The number 0 is the permission level, and it gives the user access to all commands.

## How To Remove Admins In 7D2D
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. In the server console, type `admin list` to list admins.
3. Find the ID of the admin you want to remove and type `admin remove ID`.
</Steps>

## 7D2D Admin Permission Level Configuration

Permission levels in 7D2D are set in the serveradmin.xml file on your server. To apply a permission level to a certain command, first find the command you want to limit, and then follow these steps.

<Steps>

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. In File Manager, navigate to `/.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/serveradmin.xml`.
3. Scroll down to `<Commands>`.
4. Copy this and add it to a new line under `<Commands>`, replacing the command and setting a permission level of `0-1000`.

   ```xml title="serveradmin.xml"
   <permission cmd="gettime" permission_level="1000" />
   ```
   - A level of 1000 will give all users access to the command.
   - A user's permission level must be equal to or below the commands permission level in order to have access to it.
</Steps>
