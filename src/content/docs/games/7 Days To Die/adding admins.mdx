In this guide you will learn how to add admins to your 7D2D server.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. In the sidebar click on `Management > File Manager`.
3. Select the `.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/` folder.
4. Here, find the file named `serveradmin.xml`.
5. Add a new entry on its own line under users in SteamID64 format. You can get your SteamID from [here](https://steamid.io/). It should look like this: `<user platform="Steam" userid="76561198106341655" name="[You!]" permission_level="0" />`.
