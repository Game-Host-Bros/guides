## 7D2D Admin Permission Level Configuration

Permission levels in 7D2D are set in the serveradmin.xml file on your server. To apply a permission level to a certain command, first find the command you want to limit, and then follow these steps.

<Steps>

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. In File Manager, navigate to `/.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/serveradmin.xml`.
3. Scroll down to `<Commands>`.
4. Copy this and add it to a new line under `<Commands>`, replacing the command and setting a permission level of `0-1000`.

   ```xml title="serveradmin.xml"
   <permission cmd="gettime" permission_level="1000" />
   ```
   - A level of 1000 will give all users access to the command.
   - A user's permission level must be equal to or below the commands permission level in order to have access to it.
