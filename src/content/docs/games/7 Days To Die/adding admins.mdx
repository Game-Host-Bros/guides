Looking to better manage your 7 Days To Die server by adding admins? This comprehensive guide will show you how to assign admin privileges to trusted players on your [7D2D server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/). Before you start, ensure you have the [SteamID64](https://steamid.io/) of each player you wish to promote.

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. In the sidebar click on `Management > File Manager`.
3. Select the `.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/` folder.
4. Open the file named `serveradmin.xml`.
5. Add a new entry on its own line under users in SteamID64 format. It should look like this:
   ```xml title="serveradmin.xml"
   <user platform="Steam" userid="76561198106341655" name="[You!]" permission_level="0" />
   ```
6. Restart your server.
