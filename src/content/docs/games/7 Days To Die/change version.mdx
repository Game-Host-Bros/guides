Here is how you can change your [7D2D](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/) version for both your server and game client.

## Change 7D2D Server Version
Changing the server version is only available with 7D2D Vanilla versions. As mods only work with specific versions of 7D2D, we enforce those server versions for those particular mods.
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Under `Advanced` Look for `Server Version Branch` and replace it with the version you want to use (A list of versions is below).
4. Set `Auto Update` to `Disabled`.
5. In the sidebar select `Configuration > Advanced`.
6. Click `Reinstall Server`.
</Steps>
