Here is how you can change your 7D2D version for both your server and game client.

## Change 7D2D Server Version

Changing the server version is only available with 7D2D Vanilla versions. As mods only work with specific versions of 7D2D, we enforce those server versions for those particular mods.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your 7D2D server.
3. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
4. Look for `Server Version` and enter the version you want to use such as `alpha20.7` or `latest_experimental`.
5. In the sidebar select `Configuration > Advanced`.
6. Click `Reinstall Server`.
