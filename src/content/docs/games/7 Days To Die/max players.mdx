Most [7D2D](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/) settings will be changed in the `serverconfig.xml` file, but any setting that is set in our game panel must be changed there as it will override whatever is manually set in the file. Here's how to adjust Max Players for 7D2D.
<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
2. Select `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit `Max Players`.
4. After changing, `Start` your Server.
</Steps>
