If you're getting tired of the vanilla game, you should try modded [7D2D](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/), it's a great way to experience new things and hopefully, restore the fun!

In this guide we'll be showing you how to install Mods to your server and local game client, as most Mods will need to be installed on both in order to play.

## Downloading Mods

Mods can be found from sites such as [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/) once downloaded extract the mod file.

:::tip
Make sure the mod you're installing is compatiable with your [7D2D server version](/games/7-days-to-die/change-version/).

## Installing Mods On Your Server
<Steps>

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/), upload the extracted Mod folder into `/Mods/[ModName]`.
   - For example, it should look like this.
  
   <FileTree>
   
     - mods
       - **mod1**
         - **modinfo.xml**
         - ..
       - **mod2**
         - **modinfo.xml**
         - ..
       - **mod3**
         - **modinfo.xml**
         - ..
   </FileTree>
4. Restart Your Server.
</Steps>
:::tip
Did you know? You can type `version` into the server console to see your server version and it's loaded mods.

## Installing Mods Locally On Your PC

Mods that explicitly say server-sided only will not need to be installed locally, for the rest, here's how. Do note that you may have to disable EAC Anti-Cheat on your game client to use most mods, the steps for that can be found below.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to your game files by going to `Steam > Library > 7D2D > Manage > Browse Local Files`.
2. Create a folder named `Mods` .
3. Extract your downloaded Mod Folder into `/Mods/[ModName]`.
   - Not to be confused with a folder sharing the name of an entire modpack, but each mod individually should be /mods/[ModName], for example, it should look like this.
  
   <FileTree>
   
     - mods
       - **mod1**
         - **modinfo.xml**
         - ..
       - **mod2**
         - **modinfo.xml**
         - ..
       - **mod3**
         - **modinfo.xml**
         - ..
   </FileTree>
</Steps>

You only need to install the extracted folder which directly contains `modinfo.xml` and it's other files.

## Disabling EAC Anti-Cheat Client And Server

Mods will let you know if you need to disable EAC Anti-Cheat when launching the game, follow these steps to disable EAC Anti-Cheat and successfully load your mods.
