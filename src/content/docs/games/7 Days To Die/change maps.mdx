Here is how you can change the map on your 7 Day to Die server.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your 7D2D server and stop the server.
3. Go to `Management > File Manager` and delete all the folders and files.
4. Open the `serverconfig.xml` file.
5. Look for the `GameWorld` line and change the map to one of the following.

- Navezgane - The default map.
- RWG - Randomly generates a new map according to the WorldGenSeed.
- Custom Folder Name - The name of the custom world folder located in `.local/share/7DaysToDie/GeneratedWorlds`

If you're using RWG then you will need to change `WorldGenSeed` and `WorldGenSize`. Bigger map sizes will take long to generate and you may need a higher ram plan if it fails.

6. Click Save and start your server.

## Locating And Uploading Existing World 

If you'd like to continue playing an existing world, whether it be a downloaded custom world or RWG, the steps to do it will stay the same, here's how you can upload it to your server.

### Locating Existing World

The location for your existing World and Save files can be found in Appdata, the path will look something like this, `AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie`, to find these folders, follow these steps.

1. Press `Windows Key + R`.
2. Type `%appdata%`.
3. Open `7DaysToDie`.
4. Enter `GeneratedWorlds` and `Saves` to locate your world and save files.

If you're using an existing pregen world then you won't need to do any of this, as the server will download the default worlds during installation, in that case all you need to do is first upload your save file, and then change `GameWorld` and `GameName` to your worlds respective name and save file name, the upload location for your saves will be `.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/[SaveName]`. 

:::tip
To ensure you're in the correct location, World files will contain a `Mapinfo.xml` file, while your Save file won't.

## Uploading Existing Custom World And Save Data

Now that you've located your World file, the following steps will guide you on how to upload and use it on your 7D2D server.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your 7D2D server and stop the server.
3. Navigate to `.local/share/7DaysToDie/GeneratedWorlds`.
4. Using [SFTP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your World to the `GeneratedWorlds` folder.
5. For Save data. Again, using [SFTP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your Save to `.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/[WorldName]/[SaveName]`.

## Enabling Uploaded World

Once the data has been uploaded, to allow your server to run it, you'll have to set it to use those uploaded files, specifically `GameWorld` for the map itself, and `GameName` for your save data, here's how it's done.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your 7D2D server and stop the server.
3. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
4. Open the `serverconfig.xml` file.
5. Look for the `GameWorld` line and change it to your `[WorldName]`.
6. Find the `GameName` line and change it to your `[SaveName]`.
7. Click Save, and start your server

:::tip
Your `[SaveName]`, can be found here, `AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Saves\[WorldName]\[SaveName]`.
:::

You can check to see if it's loaded correctly by watching your server Console, it should look something like this.
- **[Game Host Bros] Server marked as ON**
- World:       `[WorldName]`
- Game name:   `[SaveName]`
