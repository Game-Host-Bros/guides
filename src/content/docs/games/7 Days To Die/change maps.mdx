Here is how you can change the map on your 7 Day to Die server.
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Open the `serverconfig.xml` file.
4. Look for the `GameWorld` line and change the map to one of the following:

   - **Navezgane**: The default map.
   - **RWG**: Randomly generates a new map according to the WorldGenSeed.
   - **Custom Folder Name**: The name of the custom world folder located in `.local/share/7DaysToDie/GeneratedWorlds`

5. Click Save and start your server.
</Steps>

## Locating Existing World And Save Data

If you'd like to continue playing an existing world, whether it be a downloaded custom world or RWG, the steps to do it will stay the same, here's how you can find and upload it to your server.
<Steps>
1. Press `Windows Key + R`.
2. Type `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie`.
3. Find your world in `GeneratedWorlds` and save data in `Saves`.
</Steps>
If you're using a default pregen world, you only need to change `GameWorld` and `GameName` to the worlds respective name and save file name, the upload location for your saves will be `.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves`. 

Your World file and Save data location should look something like this.

<FileTree>

- Appdata
  - Roaming
    - 7DaysToDie
      - GeneratedWorlds
        - [WorldName]
      - Saves
        - WorldName
          - [SaveName]

</FileTree>

## Uploading Existing World And Save Data

Now that you've located your World file, the following steps will guide you on how to upload and use it on your 7D2D server.

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your server.
2. In `Management > File Manager`, navigate to `.local/share/7DaysToDie/GeneratedWorlds`.
3. Using [SFTP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your World to the `GeneratedWorlds` folder.
4. For Save data. Again, using [SFTP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your Save to `.local/share/7DaysToDie/Saves/[WorldName]/[SaveName]`.
</Steps>
Your server files should now look like this.

<FileTree>

- .local
  - share
    - 7DaysToDie
      - GeneratedWorlds
        - [WorldName]
    - Saves
      - [SaveName]

</FileTree>
## Enabling Uploaded World

Once the data has been uploaded, to allow your server to run it you'll have to set it to use those uploaded files, specifically `GameWorld` for the map itself, and `GameName` for your save data, here's how it's done.
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Open the `serverconfig.xml` file.
4. Look for the `GameWorld` line and change it to your `[WorldName]`.
5. Find the `GameName` line and change it to your `[SaveName]`.
6. Click Save, and start your server.
</Steps>

You can check to see if it's loaded correctly by watching your server Console, it should look something like this.

```bash
[Game Host Bros] Server marked as ON
World:       `[WorldName]`
Game name:   `[SaveName]`
```
