Here is how you can change the map on your 7 Day to Die server.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your 7D2D server and stop the server.
3. Go to `Management > File Manager` and delete all the folders and files.
4. Open the `serverconfig.xml` file.
6. Look for the `GameWorld` line and change the map to one of the following.

- Navezgane - The default map.
- RWG - Randomly generates a new map according to the WorldGenSeed.

If you're using RWG then you will need to change `WorldGenSeed` and `WorldGenSize`. Bigger map sizes will take long to generate and you may need a higher ram plan if it fails.

7. Save and restart your server.
