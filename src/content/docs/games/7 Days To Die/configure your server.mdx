At Game Host Bros, we've integrated [7 Days To Die](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/) settings directly into our game panel, so you can effortlessly change settings such as zombie speed, max zombies, difficulty, server name and more. Otherwise 7 Days To Die settings are normally changed in the `serverconfig.xml` file.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
