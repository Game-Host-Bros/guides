For [7 Days to Die](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/) there is really only one file that you need to be familiar with and that's `serverconfig.xml`. Please keep in mind there are some things that cannot be changed such as the Telnet port as that must be done by our staff.
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. Go to `System > Console` and Stop your server.
3. Click on `Management > File Manager.`
4. Open the file `serverconfig.xml` and replace the property values with your changes.
5. Start your server.
