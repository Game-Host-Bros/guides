At Game Host Bros, we've integrated [7 Days To Die](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/) settings directly into our game panel, so you can effortlessly change settings such as zombie speed, max zombies, difficulty, server name and more. Otherwise 7 Days To Die settings are normally changed in the `serverconfig.xml` file.

## Configuring Your 7D2D Server

<Steps>

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit the settings you'd like to change.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

:::note
If you want to manually customize your server using the `serverconfig.xml` file, you can disable `File Parser` in Configuration > Startup Parameters. 

This will stop our panel from writing to your `serverconfig.xml` file, and you will need to manually configure your server correctly. You should only consider this if you know what you're doing as incorrect configuration will make your server unable to start.
