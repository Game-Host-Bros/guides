For 7 Days to Die there is really only one file that you need to be familiar with and that's `serverconfig.xml`. Please keep in mind there are some things that cannot be changed such as the Telnet port as that must be done by our staff.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click on your 7D2D server.
3. Go to `System > Console` and Stop your server.
4. Click on `Management > File Manager.`
5. Open the file `serverconfig.xml` and replace the property values with your changes.
6. Start your server.
