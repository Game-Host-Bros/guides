This guide will show you how to enable crossplay on your [7 Days To Die Server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/) to allow Xbox Series and PS5 players to connect to your server.

## Enabling Crossplay

<Steps>

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your 7D2D server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - Set `ServerMaxPlayerCount` to a maximum of **8**
   - Set `ServerAllowCrossplay` to **True**
   - Set `EACEnabled` to **True**
   - Set `IgnoreEOSSanctions` to **False**
4. Restart your server for the changes to take effect.
</Steps>

:::caution[Crossplay Requirements]
For console players to connect to your server, you must:
- Configure all four settings exactly as shown above
- Use only console-compatible values for all server settings (see below)
- Remove any mods from your server
- Limit the server to 8 players maximum

Steam players can join regardless of settings, but Xbox and PS5 players will be unable to connect if any setting uses non-standard values.
