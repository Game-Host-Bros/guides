Twitch Integration is an extension for streamer's that allows livestream viewers to interact with the streamer's game, through chatting or donations with bits. 

This comprehensive guide covers how to install the required twitch extension, how to connect twitch to your [7D2D server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/) and much more.

Before proceeding with this guide, ensure that you're an [Admin](/games/7-days-to-die/adding-admins/) on your 7D2D server.

:::note
The default permission level required for Twitch Integration is 90.

## Installing The 7D2D Twitch Integration Extension

<Steps>

1. Login to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) and go to your `Creator Dashboard`.
2. In the sidebar select `Extensions`, and search for `7 days`.
3. Install the `7 Days to Die Integration` extension.
</Steps>

Make sure to select an overlay when installing.

## Connecting Twitch Integration To Your 7D2D Server

Again, make sure you're an [Admin](/games/7-days-to-die/adding-admins/) otherwise this won't work unless the necessary settings have been changed.

<Steps>

1. Connect to your 7D2D server.
2. Press `Esc` to open the game menu.
3. Select `Options > Twitch` and click `Login Twitch`.
   - A browser will open, automatically redirecting you to a page.
4. Click `Activate` with the code, and then click `Authorize` on the next page.
</Steps>

Now you should see `Connected: [YourTwitch]` in the bottom right of the in-game twitch menu.

## Enabling The Extension As A Viewer

Viewers must give access to the 7D2D Twitch extension in order to be able to use it, luckily it's a simple process, do this as a viewer:

<Steps>

1. Go to the Twitch Streamers channel.
2. Hover over the video and click on the 7D2D extension popup.
3. Scroll down to `Manage Access` and click `Grant`.
</Steps>

## All Viewer Commands

Here are all of the commands viewers can use for your server as per official documentation which can be found [here](https://7daystodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/twitch_documentation_rev_10_26_2023.pdf).

**All commands with an added * need to be enabled**. To configure settings use the in-game Twitch menu, by going to Actions > View Extra > Allow Action on specific commands.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Timed Out

If you're unable to connect and the steps have been followed properly, try these fixes:

- Check your firewall.
- Disable browser extensions, or try setting a new default browser.
- Restart your PC.

### The Twitch Extension Must Be Installed And Active On Your Channel

This means the 7D2D extension hasn't been activated on your twitch channel, do this to activate it:

- Login to twitch, go to `Creator Dashboard > Extensions > My Extensions` click `Activate` and select an overlay for the 7D2D twitch extension.
