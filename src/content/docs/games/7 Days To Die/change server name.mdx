This is what you do if you need to change your server name on your 7 Days To Die server, also referred to as a hostname. This is what is displayed to players in the server browser.

2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Server Name` setting and enter your desired server name.
4. Restart your server.
