This guide will cover how to add and remove players from a whitelist on your [7D2D server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/7-days-to-die-server-hosting/). Adding a whitelist is the best way to keep your server private for you and your friends, whitelists work to only allow the accounts of authorized players to join your server.

Here's how to add players to your 7D2D whitelist by using their in-game player IDs or [SteamID64](https://www.steamidfinder.com/).

Once a player is added to the whitelist it will automatically activate, and anyone who wishes to join will also need to be added.

2. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).

4. Enter this command to whitelist the user.
   ```
   whitelist add ID
   ```
   - For example:
   ```
   whitelist add 171
   ```
   - You can check the whitelist by typing `whitelist list`.
   - Type `whitelist remove ID` to remove players from your whitelist.
