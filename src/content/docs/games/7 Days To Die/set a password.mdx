This is what you do if you need to set a password on your 7 Days to Die server.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click `Startup Parameters`.
3. Look for `Server Password` and then type the password you want.
4. Go back to the console page, then restart your server.

This will override anything you set in `serverconfig.xml`.
