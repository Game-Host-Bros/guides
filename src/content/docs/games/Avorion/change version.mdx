## Changing Steam Beta Version

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Edit `Steam Beta Branch`.
4. Go to `Configuration > Advanced`.
5. Click `Reinstall Server` and wait for the install to finish.
</Steps>

Here are the currently available beta branches to choose from, they can be found here:
