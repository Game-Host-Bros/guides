Many server settings can be changed by settings via console, such as `Difficulty`, `Invincibility`, `Give` and much more. The process to become an Admin is short and simple, here are the steps to change settings on your [Necesse server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/necesse-server-hosting/).

## Becoming An Admin

<Steps>
  1. [Connect](/games/necesse/connect-to-server/) to your server
  2. While on your server log into the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
  3. Go to `System > Console`.
  4. Type `Permissions set YourName Owner`.
</Steps>
This guide uses Owner as an example as it has more permissions, the other possible roles are `User`, `Moderator`, `Admin`, `Owner` and finally `Server`, to use in-game commands follow the steps below.

## Using Commands

The input process will be the same for all commands, finding and executing commands is done like this.
<Steps>
  1. [Connect](/games/necesse/connect-to-server/) to your server
  2. Open chat with `Enter` and input your command of choice, for example, `/pm player` sends a private message to the specified user.
</Steps>
:::tip
Did you know? Some commands can be input with `list` added to display all possible inputs, take `/deathpenalty list` for example.
