Most [Necesse](https://www.gamehostbros.com/necesse-server-hosting/) settings are changed in-game through commands as per our [Adding Admins guide](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/necesse/adding-admins/). But Max Players is a little different and must be changed directly through our game panel. Here's how to adjust Max Players for Necesse.

## Setting Max Players For Necesse

<Steps>
  1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
  2. Select `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
  3. Edit `Player Slots`.
  4. After changing, `Start` your Server.
