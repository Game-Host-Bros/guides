In this guide you will learn how to install Mods to your [Core Keeper server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/core-keeper-server-hosting/). You can download Mods from [mods.io](https://Mod.io/g/corekeeper).

This guide will cover how to install Mods locally to your own game and your Core Keeper server.

          - **Mod.zip** Decompress/Extract me!
