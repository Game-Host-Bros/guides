Here is how you can connect to your [Core Keeper server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/core-keeper-server-hosting/) using a Friend Code or from the in-game server browser.

## Connecting With Your Game ID

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Core Keeper server.
2. In the sidebar, go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Open the file `GameID.txt` and copy the code.
4. Open Core Keeper, and click `Join Game` from the main menu.
5. Paste your GameID and click Join.
</Steps>

:::tip
After copying your GameID, go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` and paste the GameID into `GameID`. This way your GameID won't change after server restarts.
