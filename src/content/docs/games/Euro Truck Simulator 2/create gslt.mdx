Here is how you create a GSLT for [Euro Truck Simulator 2 server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-server-hosting/) and add it to your server. This is **required** by Valve to be displayed in the server list.

## Creating A GSLT

<Steps>
1. Go [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) and login with your Steam account.
2. Under `App ID` enter `227300` for ETS2, then name the memo anything you want. 
3. Visit [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Euro Truck Simulator 2 server.
4. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
5. Enter your token under `Steam Auth token`. 
6. Click `Console` in the sidebar and then restart your server.
</Steps>
:::note
Each ETS2 server you run requires its own GSLT.
