If you don't want to play Euro Truck Simulator 2 on the latest public version, and would rather play a different beta branch to play older versions, here's how to change the version of your [Euro Truck Simulator 2 server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-server-hosting/). 

When changing server versions, you must also change your ETS 2 game version to match the version of your server, the process for downgrading your game version can be found [here](/games/euro-truck-simulator-2/downgrade-game/).

Changing ETS 2 server versions will reset mod files, and other non-default files on your server.

Please be aware that you may experience issues with any game rollback.
