In this guide we will show you how you can add moderators to your ETS2 server. For this you will need the [steamID64](https://steamid.io/) of the players you want to make mods.
<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Moderators` and add the steamID64 of the player you want to be a mod.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>
You can also add multiple moderator steamID64 by separating them with a comma like this `76561198012345678,745611980123454432`
