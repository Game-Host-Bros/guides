At Game Host Bros we have automatic updates for [Minecraft Bedrock servers](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/) by default, this can always be toggled on-off from the game panel.

## Updating Your Minecraft Bedrock Server

By default a server will install to the `latest` version, keeping your server up-to-date with Minecraft's current patch.

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Enable `Automatic Updates`.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

Your server will now automatically restart to perform an update whenever a new Minecraft Bedrock update is released, the update delay and chat message sent can also be configured to your preferences too.
