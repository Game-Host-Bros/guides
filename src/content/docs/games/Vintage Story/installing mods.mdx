This is what you do if you need to install mods to your [Vintage Story server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/vintage-story-server-hosting/). You can download mods from the [Vintage Story website](https://mods.vintagestory.at/).

<Steps>
  1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Vintage Story server.
  2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
  3. Open the `Mods` folder and [upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/) your `plugin.zip`.
  4. Restart your server.
</Steps>
