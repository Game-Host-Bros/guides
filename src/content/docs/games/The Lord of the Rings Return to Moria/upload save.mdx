## Uploading Your Save Files

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your server.
2. In the sidebar, go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Open `MoriaServerConfig.ini` and edit `OptionalWorldFilename=` to the name of your save file, excluding .sav at the end.
4. Next, navigate to `Moria/Saved/SaveGamesDedicated`.
5. [Upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/) your save file.
6. Start your server.
</Steps>

Here's what your server should now look like:

 ```ini title="MoriaServerConfig.ini"
[World]
OptionalWorldFilename=MW_6BE7222A40EB974D3499BAB262B5D8D7
   ```

And here's your uploaded save file location:
