Managing player permissions-including granting administrative privileges or banning playersâ€”is essential for maintaining a healthy gaming environment. [The Lord of the Rings Return to Moria](https://www.gamehostbros.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-server-hosting/) uses a file called `MoriaServerPermissions.txt` to handle player permissions.

## Configuring Permissions

Here's how to configure permissions on your server, ensure that you've already [connected to your server](/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/connect-to-your-server/) before following these steps.

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your server.
2. In the sidebar, go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. In the home directory, open `MoriaServerPermissions.txt`.
4. Scroll to the bottom and find your account name.
5. Configure your desired permissions.
6. Click save and start your server.
</Steps>

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Blocked** | Will block a user with that account name. |
| **Default** | Will use the default permissions. |
| **NoConstruction** | Prevents user using any build or quickbuild functions, or deconstructing any player constructions. |
| **QuickBuild** | Allows quick-build of platforms and rope ladders, but prevents other construction or deconstruction. |
| **AllConstruction** | Allows all construction and deconstruction. |
| **NoStorage** | Prevents interaction with storage containers, and disallows using shared base storage for crafting. |
| **AllStorage** | Allows all use of storage containers and contents. |

Here are some permission examples:

   ```txt title="MoriaServerPermissions.txt"
GHB = AllConstruction,AllStorage
Jerry = Blocked
Tom = Default
   ```
This example does the following: 

- Grants the player GHB access to all construction and storage permissions.
- Blocks Jerry from connecting to your server.
- Sets Tom's permissions to default.
