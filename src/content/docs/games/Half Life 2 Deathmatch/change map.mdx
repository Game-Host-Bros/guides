This is what you do if you need to change the map on your [Half Life 2 Deathmatch server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/half-life-2-deathmatch-server-hosting/).

## Uploading Your Custom Map

Maps are commonly found from public FastDL repositories, or sites such as GameBanana. Your server will need to be restarted so our FastDL system can automatically sync your added files, this is required as these files will not be served to connecting users until a sync is completed.

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com) and `Stop` your HL2DM server.
2. Using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/) upload your map.bsp to `hl2mp/maps`.
3. Start your server.
</Steps>

## Changing Your HL2DM Server Default Map

4. Restart your server.
