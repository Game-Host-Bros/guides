Installing plugins on your [Half-Life 2 Deathmatch server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/half-life-2-deathmatch-server-hosting/) can enhance gameplay and add new features. Game Host Bros makes it easy to enable SourceMod, which is required for most plugins.

## How To Install SourceMod

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. Navigate to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` in the left sidebar.
3. Find the `Enable Sourcemod` option and change its value to `1`.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

Whenever your server starts Sourcemod and Metamod will automatically stay up-to-date with the latest stable version.

## How To Install Plugins

Once SourceMod is installed, you can start adding plugins to your server:
<Steps>
1. In the sidebar go to `Management > File Manager`.
2. Navigate to the `/hl2mp/addons/sourcemod/plugins` directory.
3. Upload your plugin files (usually ending in .smx) to this directory.
4. Restart your server or use the `sm plugins refresh` command in the server console.
</Steps>

## How To Install Extensions

Some plugins require additional extensions to function properly. Here's how to install them:
<Steps>
1. In the file manager, go to the `/hl2mp/addons/sourcemod/extensions/` directory.
2. Upload the extension files (ending in .so for Linux) to this directory.
3. If the extension came with a .cfg file, upload it to `hl2mp/cfg/sourcemod`.
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

Always make sure you're using extensions compatible with Linux and your SourceMod version.
