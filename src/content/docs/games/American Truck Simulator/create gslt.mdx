Here is how you create a GSLT for American Truck Simulator and add it to your server. This is **required** by Valve to be displayed in the server list.

1. Go [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) and login with your Steam account.
2. Under `App ID` enter `270880` for ATS, then name the memo anything you want. 
3. Visit [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your American Truck Simulator server.
4. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
5. Enter your token under `Steam Auth token`. 
6. Click `Console` in the sidebar and then restart your server.

:::note
Each ATS server you run requires its own GSLT.
