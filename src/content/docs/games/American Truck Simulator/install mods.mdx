To upload mods to your server you first need to activate them locally, here's how to activate, export, and upload the necessary files to run mods on your new [American Truck Simulator server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-server-hosting/).

## Locally Enabling And Exporting Mods For An ATS Server

If you haven't already, you will need to enable the American Truck Simulator in-game console, this can be done by following our guide [here](/games/american-truck-simulator/enable-console/)
<Steps>

1. Open ATS and under `Mods` select the mods you'd like to activate, then click `Confirm Changes`.
2. Load into a career game, and then open console with `~`.
3. Type `export_server_packages` and press enter.
4. Find the exported files by pressing `Windows Key + R` and entering this.
   ```
   %USERPROFILE%\Documents\American Truck Simulator
   ```
5. Make a copy of `server_packages.dat` and `server_packages.sii`, then proceed to the steps below.
</Steps>


## Uploading Mods To Your ATS Server

Now that you've enabled and locally exported your server_packages.dat and server_packages.sii files, they just need to be uploaded to your ATS server, here's how it's done.

<Steps>

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your ATS server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Inside of `.local/share/American Truck Simulator` delete the existing `server_packages.dat` and `server_packages.sii` files.
4. [Upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/) your exported `server_packages.dat` and `server_packages.sii`.
   <FileTree>
    - .local
      - share
        - American-Truck-Simulator
          - **server_packages.dat** Uploaded version
          - **server_packages.sii** Uploaded version
          - ..
   </FileTree>
5. Start your server.
