If you don't want to play American Truck Simulator on the latest public version, and would rather play a different beta branch to play older versions, here's how to change the version of your [American Truck Simulator server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/american-truck-simulator-server-hosting/). 

When changing server versions, you must also change your ATS game version to match the version of your server, the process for downgrading your game version can be found [here](/games/american-truck-simulator/downgrade-game/).

Changing ATS server versions will reset mod files, and other non-default files on your server.

Please be aware that you may experience issues with any game rollback.
