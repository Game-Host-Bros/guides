This is how you can revert your American Truck Simulator game version to play on [American Truck Simulator servers](https://www.gamehostbros.com/american-truck-simulator-server-hosting/) that use different versions. Normally when an update releases for the game client, this same update can be delayed for days until SCS also releases updated dedicated server software. Follow these steps to downgrade your American Truck Simulator version.

1. Open Steam.
2. Click Libraries, then right-click `American Truck Simulator > Properties`.
3. Select `Betas`.
4. Choose the Beta you'd like to use.
