In this guide, you will learn how to set the Server MOTD, Banner Image and Website Link on your Killing Floor 2 server.

1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Click `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Look for `Banner Link (Image)`, `Server MOTD` and `Website Link`. Change these to your desired settings.
4. Go back to the console page, then restart your server.

Some things to keep in mind:
- **Banner Link** **must** be a PNG (save it > 8bit) image
- **Server MOTD** is the message displayed under the Banner Link image. You can use `\n` to create a new line.
- **Website Link** is the url of your website (if you edit this from the webadmin, it resets to a blank value after saving).
