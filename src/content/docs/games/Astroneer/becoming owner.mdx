In this guide we will show you how to become owner on your [Astroneer server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/astroneer-server-hosting/). Before proceeding, you will need the [steamID64](https://steamid.io/) and username of your Steam account.

## Becoming Owner

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find `Server Owner Name` and input your Steam username.
4. Find `Server Owner SteamID` and add your [SteamID64](https://steamid.io/).
5. Start your server.
</Steps>

Now when you connect to your server you'll see that you're an Admin in the main menu. You now have access to manage saves, create a whitelist and more.
