It's common to enable flight on your [Minecraft server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/), change difficulty, toggle pvp, change motd and much more. To change Minecraft server settings you'll have to edit a file named `server.properties`. Alternatively, for more advanced users, you can make yourself [OP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/minecraft/adding-admins/) and make many of these changes via in-game commands.

## Changing Server Settings

<Steps>
  1. Log into the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
  2. Stop your server.
  3. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
  4. Open `server.properties`.
  5. Edit the settings you want to change.
  6. Start your server.
