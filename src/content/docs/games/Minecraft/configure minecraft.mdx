It's common to enable flight on your [Minecraft server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/), change difficulty, toggle pvp, change motd and much more. To change Minecraft server settings you'll have to edit a file named `server.properties`. Alternatively, for more advanced users, you can make yourself [OP](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/minecraft/adding-admins/) and make many of these changes via in-game commands.

## Changing Server Settings

<Steps>
  1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Minecraft server.
  2. Go to `Configuration > File Manager`.
  3. Open `server.properties`, edit the settings you want to change and then click save.  
  4. Start your Server.
</Steps>

These are the most commonly changed Minecraft server settings. A full list can be found [Here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties).
