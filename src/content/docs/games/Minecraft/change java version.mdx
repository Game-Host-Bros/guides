By default, the Game Host Bros panel will detect what version of Java you need. However, some mod packs will require you to use a specific version of Java otherwise they won't start.

1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Minecraft server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Find `disable_prompt_for_java_version` and delete it.
4. Restart your server and type what number you want to select your desired Java version.

You can change the Java version at any time without affecting anything on your server.
