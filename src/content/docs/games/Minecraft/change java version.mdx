By default, the Game Host Bros panel will detect what version of Java you need. However, some mod packs will require you to use a specific version of Java otherwise they won't start.

## Changing Java Version

<Steps>
  1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Minecraft server.
  2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
  3. Find `disable_prompt_for_java_version` and delete it.
  4. Restart your server and type what number you want to select your desired Java version.
</Steps>
You can change the Java version at any time without affecting anything on your server.
