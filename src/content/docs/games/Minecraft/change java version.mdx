By default, the Game Host Bros panel will detect what version of Java you need. However, some mod packs will require you to use a specific version of Java otherwise they won't start.

## Changing Java Version

<Steps>
  1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Minecraft server.
  2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
  3. Look for `Java Version` and set it to the version you want to use.  
  4. Start your Server.
</Steps>
You can change the Java version at any time without affecting anything on your server.
