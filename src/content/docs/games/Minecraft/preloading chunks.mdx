This is what you do if you want to preload chunks on your [Minecraft server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/), preloading chunks is a great way to help minimize performance issues if your server is having trouble loading too many chunks while you're trying to explore.

## Installing A Pregeneration Plugin

This is how to install and use Chunky to preload chunks on your Minecraft server using our plugin manager. Most of the plugins in our panel are for Paper or Spigot versions, you must use Paper to install to follow this guide. For other versions follow [this guide](/games/minecraft/installing-plugins/#manually-installing-most-plugins).

:::danger
If you're using our Plugin Manager as per this guide, you must [set your Minecraft server version](/games/minecraft/changing-versions/) to Paper.

<Steps>
  1. Log into the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
  2. Stop your server.
  3. Go to `Tools > Plugin Manager`.
  4. Search for the Plugin you want to install, for this example we'll be using `Chunky`.
  5. Click `Install` and Start your server.
</Steps>

## Preloading Chunks Using Chunky

Now that you've installed Chunky, this is how you begin preloading chunks.
<Steps>
  1. Log into the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
  2. Go to `System > Console`.
  3. Set a radius to preload chunks, by typing `chunky radius <radius>`.
  4. To start the generation type `chunky start`.
</Steps>

By default this will generate the overworld, while `chunky start the_nether` and `the_end` will generate their respective zones.
 
Now Chunky will begin pregeneration, you can track the progress through the server Console.

:::danger
Preloading chunks will use a lot of server resources, it may temporarily cause performance issues if you have a large world with a lot of entities.

:::tip
Did you know? You can use a Plugin alongside Chunky such as `ChunkyBorder` if you want to limit the worldborder to your preloaded chunks.
