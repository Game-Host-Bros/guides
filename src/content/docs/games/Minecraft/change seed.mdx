If you'd like to change your [Minecraft server's](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/) world seed, here's where to find the setting and how it's done.

## Changing Level Seed

<Steps>
  1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
  2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
  3. Change `World Name` to `newworld` or anything you want.
  4. Look for `World Seed` and set it to the value you want to use.  
  5. Start your Server.
</Steps>

If you'd like to go back to your old world, you can simply change `World Name` back to `world`, or it's previous value.

:::tip
When changing Minecraft Server settings outside of the game, you have to restart your server for the changes to apply.
