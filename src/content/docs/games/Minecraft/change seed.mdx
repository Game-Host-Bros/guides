If you'd like to change your [Minecraft server's](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/) world seed, here's where to find the setting and how it's done.

## Changing Level Seed

<Steps>
  1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
  2. Click `Management > File Manager`.
  3. Delete your current `World` files.
  4. Open `server.properties`.
  5. Edit `level-seed=` and Save File.  
  6. Start your Server.
</Steps>

If you'd like to keep your old world you can simply change `level-name=` to something else in `server.properties`.

:::tip
When changing Minecraft Server settings outside of the game, you have to restart your server for the changes to apply.
