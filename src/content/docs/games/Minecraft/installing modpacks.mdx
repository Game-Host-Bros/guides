This is what you do if you need to install a Modpack to your [Minecraft server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/). We recommend installing modpacks to a fresh Minecraft Server to avoid possible conflicts.

## Installing Modpacks

<Steps>
  1. Find the link for the Modpack you want from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/) (example https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-forge-bmc4).
  2. Log into the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Minecraft server.
  3. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` and select the `Mods` tab.
  4. Look for `Modpack URL` and paste in your CurseForge link and restart your server.
</Steps>

You may need to select `Erase Files On Modpack Change` if you're changing Modpacks. Enabling this setting **will wipe your server** but move your existing world to the `/backups` folder.

## Manually Installing Modpacks To Your Server

We recommend using CurseForge to find and install Modpacks to your server and game client. Modpacks on CurseForge normally have a separate download for servers. This guide is suitable for most cases.

<Steps>

  1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
  2. In the sidebar, go to `Configuration > Advanced > Install Different Edition`.
  3. Select the compatible version and edition of your modpack and click `Format`.
     - **If you want to keep any files, manually download a backup before doing this!**
  4. Start your server, once fully started, Stop your server.
  5. Drag your Modpack.zip into File Manager to upload it, and then `Decompress` the .zip by clicking the three dots.
     - Uploading a .zip is preferred as it's faster, but you can also upload everything uncompressed with [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/#using-sftp) if you're having trouble.
     - Use [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/#using-sftp) if your modpack is over 1GB.
     - The upload location will be the home directory of your server, when you click File Manager it should look something like this.
     <FileTree>
     - File-Manager
       - **mods**
       - **config**
       - **forge-wrapper.jar** example
       - **server.properties**
       - **ops.txt**
       - **libraries**
       - **world**
       - ..
     </FileTree>
  5. Start your server.
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

Here are the most common issues you may run into when installing mods to your Minecraft server. We recommended following these in order.

### Immediate Crashing

This may be because the server is using an incompatible java version, the automatic version is usually correct, but can be wrong from time to time. Try these steps to troubleshoot it:

- Double check that the server .jar file is set correctly in `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
- In `Configuration > Startup Parameters` change the java version restart your server, you may need to try this a couple of times, `Automatic` works for 99% of cases.
- Make sure the upload was successful, files larger than 1GB need to be uploaded using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/#using-sftp).

### Version Compatibility

Some modpacks won't have a premade server download and will need additional configuration, this will be something you will have to look out for. The easiest way to solve this is by doing the following:

- Check the Modpacks compatible Mod loader and version on it's download page.
- Make sure your Minecraft server has the correct [game version](/games/minecraft/changing-versions/) installed if the Modpack didn't include a .jar file.

As a tip, Mod loaders such as Forge and NeoForge are different, while they may have similar names, they are **NOT** cross-compatible.

### Generating World Crashing

Larger mod packs **WILL** require more resources. If your server is crashing when trying to generate the world, here's how to check if you have enough resources to run the Modpack.

- Check `System > Audit Logs` or watch your resources to check. If this is the issue you will need to [upgrade your server](/account/upgrade-your-server/).

### Connection Refused

If you've just manually installed a Modpack and can't connect to your server, and your error message is just refused connection with no information, try the following:

- Restart your server.
- Ensure you're correcting with the correct IP address.

If you're still unable to connect please contact a bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr)

### Mismatched Mods

Mods in Modpacks will also need to be installed locally to your game-client. When trying to connect to your server, if you have any problems such as mismatched mods, try these steps:

- Download the missing Mods.
- Delete them from your game and server files then try again.

These are the most common troubleshooting methods, if you're still unable to get connected or if you get stuck at any time, you can reach out to a Bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr).
