This is what you do if you need to install a Modpack to your Minecraft Java Edition Server. We recommend installing modpacks to a fresh Server.

## Installing Modpacks

1. Log into the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your server.
3. Stop your server.
3. Go to `Tools > Modpack Manager`.
4. Select the Modpack and version you want to install.
5. Enable `Format` (READ NOTE) and install the Modpack.

:::danger
Enabling Format will wipe your server to make sure all of the server versions are correct to run the Modpack, If you have any data you wish to keep make a backup!

## Troubleshooting

Most Modpacks will need to be installed locally on your game-client. When trying to connect to your server, if you have any problems such as mismatched mods. You can either, download the Mods and install them manually to the server and your client, or if you have Mods the server doesn't, you can delete them from your game files and try to connect again.

Make sure to double-check for version compatibility and Mod dependencies if you're having trouble connecting.

If the server starts successfully and you're unable to join, this will mean there's likely an error within your game files.
