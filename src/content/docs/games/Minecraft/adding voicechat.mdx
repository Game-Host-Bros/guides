## Installing Simple Voice Chat To Your Minecraft Server

:::note
Before getting started make sure to [change your Minecraft server version](http://localhost:4321/games/minecraft/changing-versions/) to a version compatible with Simple Voice Chat.

Official installation instructions for Simple Voice Chat can be found here: https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/server_setup
:::

In this example we'll be installing [Simple Voice Chat 1.21.4 Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat/files/5998380).

<Steps>
1. Download a version of [Simple Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat/).
2. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Minecraft server.
3. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
4. [Upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/) your downloaded voicechat.jar to `Mods`.
5. Start your server.
</Steps>

### Enabling Simple Voice Chat On Your Minecraft Server

After following the above steps and installing Simple Voice Chat, here's how to configure this mod on your server.

:::tip
Simple Voice Chat requires configuration, specifically a port to run on. A port is the number at the end of your IP address after the colon **:**. 

For example if your IP is `111.123.144.15:27033` - `27033` is a port.

Your available ports can be seen in `Management > Allocations`, we don't recommend using your Primary port for Simple Voice Chat.
:::

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Minecraft server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
3. Navigate to `/config/voicechat/` and open `voicechat-server.properties`.
4. Edit `port=` to a non-primary port found in `Management > Allocations` and click save.
5. Start your server.
</Steps>

After connecting to your server press `V` to configure Voice Chat in-game.
