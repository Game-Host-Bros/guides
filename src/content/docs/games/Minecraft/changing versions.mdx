Many Mods and Plugins are only compatible with certain Minecraft versions, in order to run older game versions and plugins you'll have to change the version of your Minecraft server. This is what you do if you need to change your Minecraft Server version.

1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your server.
3. Go to `Configuration > Advanced`.
4. Select the new edition and version you want under `Install Different Edition`.
5. Enable `Format` and click `Install Different Edition`.

:::danger
Format will delete all of your files to make sure the version changes successfully. Create a backup if you have anything you want to keep!
