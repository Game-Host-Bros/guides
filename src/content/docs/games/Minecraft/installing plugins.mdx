This is what you do if you need to install plugins to your [Minecraft server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/).

## Installing Using Our Plugin Manager

<Steps>
  1. Log into the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Minecraft server.
  2. Go to `Tools > Plugin Manager`.

  4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

Some plugins may not work with the latest versions of the game, so we suggest checking the plugin requirements before installing and making sure you're on the correct version.
