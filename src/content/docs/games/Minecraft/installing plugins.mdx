This is what you do if you need to install plugins to your [Minecraft server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/).

## Installing Using Our Plugin Manager

:::danger
If you're using our Plugin Manager you must [set your Minecraft server version](/games/minecraft/changing-versions/) to either Spigot or Paper. If you try and run plugins on the Vanilla game or Forge they **will not work**.
:::

<Steps>
  1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Minecraft server.
  2. Go to `Tools > Plugin Manager`.
  3. Select the plugins you want to install.
  4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

Some plugins may not work with the latest versions of the game, so we suggest checking the plugin requirements before installing and making sure you're on the correct version.

## Manually Installing Most Plugins

If you're not on Paper or Spigot then our panel plugins won't work, here's how to upload plugins to your server after finding a plugin that is compatible with your current Minecraft edition and version, plugins can be found from a site such as [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugins).

<Steps>
  1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Minecraft server.
  2. Go to `Configuration > File Manager`.
  3. Open the `plugins` folder and [upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/) your extracted `plugin.jar`.
  4. Restart your server.
</Steps>
