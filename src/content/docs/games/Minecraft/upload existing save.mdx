This is what you do if you need to upload an existing world to your [Minecraft server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/).

## Finding Local Worlds On The Vanilla Minecraft Launcher

<Steps>
  1. On your keyboard press `Windows Key + R`. 
  2. Enter this:
     ```
     %APPDATA%\.minecraft\saves
     ```
  3. Make a copy of your existing world file.
</Steps>

## Finding Local Worlds On The CurseForge Launcher

<Steps>
1. Open CurseForge.
2. Right-Click on your Minecraft Instance, and select `Open Folder`.
3. Make a copy of your existing world file found in the `saves` folder.
</Steps>

## Uploading Worlds To Your Minecraft Server

<Steps>
  1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and Stop your server.
  2. Connect to your server via `SFTP` by following [this guide](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/getting-started/uploading-files/).
  3. Upload your existing save file to the home directory of your server.
  4. In the panel, go to `Management > File Manager`, and open `server.properties`.
  5. Set `level-name=` to your world name.
  6. Start your server.
</Steps>

You can alternatively upload your world folder as is, and simply choose which world to load by finding server.properties in your server's home directory, and changing `level-name=` to reflect the name of your uploaded world.

If you wish to keep a copy of the current World on your server, make sure to create a backup before deleting!
