This is what you do if you need to install Mods to your [Minecraft server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/minecraft-server-hosting/).

This guide should be followed after ensuring your server is running an edition and version compatible with your desired mods, here is our [changing version guide](/games/minecraft/changing-versions/).

## Manually Installing Mods

:::danger
If you're installing mods you must [set your Minecraft server version](/games/minecraft/changing-versions/), to the edition and version compatible with the mod you're installing, for example Forge is the most popular edition for Modded Minecraft. If you try and run Mods on the Vanilla game they **will not work**.

Furthermore, some mods are **NOT** compatible with dedicated servers, we always recommend installing a few mods at a time and then testing, to make sure everything is working as expected.

<Steps>
  1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Minecraft server.
  2. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
  3. Open the `Mods` folder and [upload](/getting-started/uploading-files/) your `mod.jar` file.
     - Use [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/#using-sftp) for multiple or large file uploads.
  4. Start your server.
