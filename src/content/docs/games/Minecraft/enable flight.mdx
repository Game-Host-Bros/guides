In Minecraft there's a common error where you may get kicked for "Flying is not enabled on this server", here's how to fix this.
<Steps>
  1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Server.
  2. Click `Management > File Manager`.
  3. Open `server.properties`.
  4. Set `allow-flight=` to `allow-flight=true` and Save File.  
  5. Start your Server.
</Steps>

When changing Minecraft Server settings outside of the game or server console, you have to restart your server for the changes to apply.
