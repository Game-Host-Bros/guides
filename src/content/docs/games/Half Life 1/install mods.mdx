In this guide we will show you how you can install mods on your [Half Life Deathmatch server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/half-life-1-server-hosting/). This will allow you to host other games such as The Specialist, Ricochet etc.

Half-Life is an old game and it has been around for 25+ years. There will be mods that simply will not work. We suggest doing some research to see if the mod you want to use still works or reach out to a bro for advice. Make sure your mod is for Linux and is a Multiplayer mod.

## Installing Mods

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Half Life Deathmatch server.
2. Download and extract your mod to your PC, then upload the root folder to your server using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/#using-sftp). You should only be uploading a single folder without overwriting anything.
3. In the sidebar go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` and look for the setting `Custom Game Folder`.
4. Change it to the name of the folder you just uploaded. (Example change it to `ts` for The Specialist, `cstrike` for Counter-Strike)
5. Update `Start Map` to a map that is included in your mods maps folder.
6. Restart your server.
