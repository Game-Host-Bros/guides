In this guide, we will show you how to edit every setting on your [ASKA server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/aska-server-hosting/). 

ASKA has two types of settings, some are normal and can be edited freely, while enabling others require an additional step. This guide covers everything you need to know about ASKA server settings.

## Configuring Your ASKA Server

At Game Host Bros, we've integrated ASKA settings into our game panel, allowing you to customize your server quickly and easily.
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your server.
2. In the sidebar, click `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Sort by `Basic`, `Advanced`, `Normal` or `Custom`.
4. Edit the setting you want to change.
5. Start your server.
</Steps>

:::tip
Some ASKA settings require your server gameplay mode to be `custom`, this can be changed in `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.

Here are all of the available settings for your ASKA server, sorted by `normal` and `custom` mode settings:
