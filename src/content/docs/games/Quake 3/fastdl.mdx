Quake 3 Arena by default doesn't let players download from your server, but at Game Host Bros, we have your server set to `sv_allowDownload 1`. This means that any player can join and download maps.

When you have lots of custom maps, there are 2 ways that players can download content from your server:
- **Default download:** This uses the server as the map host, easier but slower.
- **FastDL:** This uploads the maps to a web server, slightly harder but much faster.

This guide assumes you have already [uploaded custom maps](https://portal.gamehostbros.com/knowledgebase/25/How-To-Add-Custom-Maps-To-Quake-3-Arena.html) to your server.

:::caution
Players must have `cl_allowDownload 1` to be able to join a server with custom maps or have `Allow Downloading` turned on under `Setup > Options`. **This MUST also be set for any mods they play**, so load the mod first, and then run the command or turn to `Allow Downloading`.

## How To Sync Your FastDL
<Steps>
1. Go to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. On the left-hand side, go to `Tools > FastDL`.
3. Click `Sync FastDL`.
4. Copy the address to your FastDL it looks something like this: `http://lonestar.gamehostbros.com/a8341d7b`
5. Open your `server.cfg`, located in `baseq3/server.cfg`.
6. Add `sv_dlUrl "http://lonestar.gamehostbros.com/a8341d7b"` into your server.cfg (Replace the URL with your unique FastDL url)
7. Restart your server.
</Steps>
:::danger
If you upload new maps to the server, you **MUST** re-sync your FastDL each time a map is added. Failing to do this means players won't be able to connect to your server. You do not need to add a new config as the existing config is already there.
