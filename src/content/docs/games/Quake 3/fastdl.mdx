At Game Host Bros, we offer FastDL for your [Quake 3 Arena server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/quake-3-arena-server-hosting/) so players can download custom files such as maps, models and materials quickly. Everything is automatic and there is no extra configuration required on your end other than uploading your custom content. 

:::caution
Players must have `cl_allowDownload 1` to be able to join a server with custom maps or have `Allow Downloading` turned on under `Setup > Options`. **This MUST also be set for any mods they play**, so load the mod first, and then run the command or turn to `Allow Downloading`.
:::

## How Does FastDL Work?
While everything is automatic, there are still some things you should know about our FastDL system:
- Files are synced to `/fastdl/` when you start your server.
- `sv_downloadurl` is automatically added to `baseq3/fastdl.cfg`.
- Files only get served to players after everything is compressed.
- You can view all the files online by checking your FastDL url directly. You can get it by typing `sv_downloadurl` into your console.

Here is a list of folders and file types in those folders we sync.

| Folder | Extensions |
|--------|------------|
| baseq3/maps | .bsp, .aas |
| baseq3/models | .md3, .mdr, .tag |
| baseq3/sound | .wav, .ogg |
| baseq3/scripts | .shader, .arena, .menu |
| baseq3/textures | .jpg, .tga, .png |
| baseq3/vm | .qvm |
| baseq3 | .pk3 |
| baseq3/botfiles | .aas |
| mods | .pk3 |

If what you require isn't listed, please reach out to a bro, and we will add what you require.

## Using A Third Party FastDL
If you want to use an external FastDL you can do so by adding another config that runs after `server.cfg`.

<Steps>
1. Create a `custom_fastdl.cfg` in your game folder or cfg folder where your `server.cfg` is located.
2. Add the line `set sv_downloadurl www.myfastdlurl.com` and `set sv_dlurl www.myfastdlurl.com`.
3. Go back to your `server.cfg` and add the line `exec custom_fastdl` to the bottom of the file.
4. Restart your server.
