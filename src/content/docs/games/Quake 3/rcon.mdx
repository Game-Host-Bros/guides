This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and manage your [Quake 3 Arena server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/quake-3-arena-server-hosting/) using RCON.

## Enabling RCON

By default, Quake 3 Arena servers have remote administration turned off so you need to activate it. You can do this by setting an RCON password.
<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. In the console type `\seta rconpassword "your_password"`.
</Steps>
## Sending RCON Commands From In Game

There are a few ways you can send commands to the server using RCON.

1. Sending the password with each remote command, for example:
`\rcon "your_password" status`

2. You can also set the `rconpassword` on your client, similar to the server setup. Subsequent commands can omit the password, for example:
`\rcon status`

3. To manage a server without connecting to it, players should set the `rconaddress` variable to the server's IP address.

## RCON Commands

With remote access configured, players can now issue various commands to manage the server effectively. Some of the essential commands include:

- Changing the map - `\rcon map "map_name"`
- Removing a player from the server - `\rcon kick "user_name"`
- Adding a bot to the game - `\rcon addbot "bot_name" "skill_level [1-5]"`
