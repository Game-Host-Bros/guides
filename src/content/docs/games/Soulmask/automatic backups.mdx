At Game Host Bros, we automatically take a backup snapshot of your [Soulmask](https://www.gamehostbros.com/soulmask-server-hosting/) save files every few hours the server is live. This means if there is a failed update or a bug you're able to restore to a previous time. Giving you access to saved data in case something goes wrong. 

## Automatic Backup Restoration Guide

Here's how to restore an automatic backup of your world.db save file for Soulmask.

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Soulmask server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager` and download a copy of the backup you want to restore from the `Backups` folder in the home directory of your server. 
3. Using [SFTP](/getting-started/uploading-files/) Upload your backup to `WS/Saved/Worlds/Dedicated/Level01_Main`.
4. Delete your existing `world.db` file.
5. Rename your restored backup to `world.db`.
6. Start your server.
