## Soulmask Save File Locations

There are 2 main files that you need for Soulmask. One is the game configuration (GameXishu.json) and the save data itself (world.db).

**Dedicated Server:**
<FileTree>
- WS
  - Saved
    - Gameplay
      - Settings
        - **GameXishu.json**
    - Worlds
      - Dedicated
        - Level01_Main
          - **world.db**
</FileTree>

**Local Windows PC:**
<FileTree>
- %LOCALAPPDATA%
  - WS
    - [YOUR-STEAM-ID]
      - 2646460
        - AutoGames
          - [YOUR-GAME-INVITE-ID]
            - **GameXishu.json** Optional, this file contains your world settings.
            - **world.db**
</FileTree>

To quickly access these files locally, press `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard and enter
  ```
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\WS
  ```

## Transfer From Another Soulmask Dedicated Server
<Steps>
1. On your existing server, open the file browser and download these 2 files.
   - `/WS/Saved/GameplaySettings/GameXishu.json`
   - `/WS/Saved/Worlds/Dedicated/Level01_Main/world.db`
2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Soulmask server.
3. Go to `Management > File Manager`
4. Once there navigate to the same locations as above and delete the existing `GameXishu.json` and `world.db` files. (Assuming you don't want to save them, otherwise back them up)
5. Drag in your files from your previous server.
6. Start your Soulmask server.
</Steps>

## Transfer From A Local PC

<Steps>
1. Press `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard and enter this:
    ```
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\WS
    ```
2. You will now see some folders, navigate to the one that has your Steam ID. (Example: 76561198106341655)
3. Navigate to `2646460\AutoGames\` and then select the folder with the same invite code as the world you want to transfer.
4. Copy the `world.db` and the latest `GameXishu.json` file. If your file is called `GameXishu_2.json`, then rename it to `GameXishu.json`.
5. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your Soulmask server.
6. Go to `Management > File Manager`.
7. Navigate to `/WS/Saved/GameplaySettings/` and replace the existing `GameXishu.json` file.
8. Navigate to `/WS/Saved/Worlds/Dedicated/Level01_Main/` and replace the existing `world.db` file.
9. Start your Soulmask server.
</Steps>
