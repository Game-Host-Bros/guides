## Soulmask Save File Locations

Here is where the save files are located for Soulmask.

**Dedicated Server:**
- `/WS/Saved/GameplaySettings/GameXishu.json`
- `/WS/Saved/Worlds/Dedicated/Level01_Main/world.db`

**Local Windows PC:**
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WS\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\2646460\AutoGames\{YOUR-GAME-INVITE-ID}\GameXishu.json`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WS\{YOUR-STEAM-ID}\2646460\AutoGames\{YOUR-GAME-INVITE-ID}\world.db`

## Transfer From Another Soulmask Dedicated Server

1. On your existing server, open the file browser and download these 2 files.

2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Soulmask server.
