In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of uploading an existing world and player save file to your Soulmask dedicated server.

You may also refer to this guide on how to [upload files to your game server.](/getting-started/uploading-files/)

If you get stuck at any time, Game Host Bros offers free world transfers. Just reach out to a bro on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FN4XgbAwzr)

## Transfer from another Soulmask dedicated server

1. On your existing server, open the file browser and download these 2 files.
- `/WS/Saved/GameplaySettings/GameXishu.json`
- `/WS/Saved/Worlds/Dedicated/Level01_Main/world.db`
2. Login to the [Game Host Bros Game Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and stop your Soulmask server.
3. In the Game Host Bros panel go to `Managment > File Manager`
4. Once there navigate to the same locations as above and delete the existing `GameXishu.json` and `world.db` files. (Assuming you don't want to save them, otherwise back them up)
5. Drag in your files from your previous server.
6. Start your Soulmask server.
