By default, Game Host Bros Soulmask servers will automatically update when the server is restarted. This is how you can update your [Soulmask server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/soulmask-server-hosting/) after an update. 

## Updating Your Soulmask Server

<Steps>
1. Access the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and `Stop` your server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Auto Update` toggle and make sure it's enabled.
4. `Start` your server.
</Steps>

The server will now automatically download the update as soon as it starts.
