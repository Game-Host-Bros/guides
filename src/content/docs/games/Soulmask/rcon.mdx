This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and manage your Soulmask server using RCON. This is a fairly new feature and is also sometimes referred to as TELNET in the Soulmask community.

:::caution
By default, we don't allocate you an external port for Soulmask RCON as it's insecure. Simply contact support, and we will add this to your server for you if needed. You can still use all commands directly from our web panel console.
