## How To Get Your Workshop Mod IDs

You will need to know how to get a Workshop ID for each mod you want to install. You can [view all the Soulmask mods here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2646460/workshop/)

Once you find the mod you want you need to copy the URL. Let's use this URL for example: [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3070288532&searchtext=bhop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3070288532&searchtext=bhop)

![CS2 workshop URL](../../../../assets/guide-images/cs2-workshop-screenshot.jpg)

As you can see from the numbers in the URL, our map ID is `3070288532`

## How To Install Soulmask Workshop Mods
<Steps>
1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Soulmask server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Look for the `Workshop Mods` section and add the IDs for the mods you want like this.
   - For a single mod: `3325629900`
   - For multiple mods: `3325629900,3325143163,3325592770`
4. Restart your server.
</Steps>

You can then confirm if the mods have been installed by going to your file manager and looking in `/WS/Mods`. You should see all your Soulmask mods there if they downloaded successfully.
