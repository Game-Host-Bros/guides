In this guide, we will show you how to change the server difficulty on your Enshrouded server.

## Difficulty Presets (Beginner)
By default, Enshrouded comes with 5 difficulty presets that you can use to quickly adjust how hard the game is. We allow you to adjust these directly from our Game Panel.

1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your V Rising server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Difficulty` setting and change it to the desired difficulty.
4. Restart your server.

Here are the Enshrouded difficulty presets you can select and what they do.

- **Default** - The “Default” difficulty setting configures all values to default. It is the direct continuation of how Enshrouded was first configured and is the recommended setting for first-time players.
- **Relaxed** - The “Relaxed” preset reduces the amount of enemies and provides players with more resources and loot. This mode targets players who are most interested in base-building and light-hearted adventuring.
- **Hard** - The “Hard” preset increases the amount of enemies and makes them more aggressive to give players a tougher combat experience.
- **Survival** - The “Survival” preset is for those who seek some punishment with additional survival mechanics on top of more aggressive enemies.
- **Custom** - When “Custom” is selected, a long list of individual settings can be tweaked. This setting is required if you manually adjust your enshrouded_server.json file.

## Editing enshrouded_server.json (Advance)
If you want to tweak individual game settings, you will need to do it from the `enshrouded_server.json` file.

1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Enshrouded server.
2. Stop your Enshrouded server.
3. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
4. Find the `Difficulty` setting and change it to `Custom`.
5. Go to `Management > File Manager` and open the file `enshrouded_server.json`.
6. After you have made the changes you want, start the server. 

The following options can be modified in the `enshrouded_server.json` file, under the `gameSettings` section.
