In this guide you will learn how to setup custom permissions and groups for your Enshrouded server. This is designed for **advance users** who need granular control of their server.

:::danger
If you only need to add admins to your server, the Game Host Bros Game Panel will handle that for you. You can read how to [add admins to Enshrouded here.](/games/enshrouded/server-roles/)
:::
<Steps>
1. Login to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your Enshrouded server.
2. Go to `Management > File Manager` and open the file `enshrouded_server.json`.
3. Under the `userGroups` section, add the roles you require. 
</Steps>
Here is an example of how your userGroups section should look like with multiple roles. There are some groups added already by our panel such as the Admin and Everyone group. If you want to delete this admin group then you must go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters` and set `Admin Password` so its blank.

```json title="enshrouded_server.json"
{
    "name": "Enshrouded Server",
    "ip": "0.0.0.0",
    "userGroups": [
        {
            "name": "Admin",
            "password": "Randomized password 01",
            "canKickBan": true,
            "canAccessInventories": true,
            "canEditBase": true,
            "canExtendBase": true,
            "reservedSlots": 1
        },
        {
            "name": "Friend",
            "password": "Randomized password 02",
            "canKickBan": false,
            "canAccessInventories": true,
            "canEditBase": true,
            "canExtendBase": true,
            "reservedSlots": 3
        },
        {
            "name": "Everyone",
            "password": "Randomized password 03",
            "canKickBan": false,
            "canAccessInventories": false,
            "canEditBase": false,
            "canExtendBase": false,
            "reservedSlots": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

Passwords must be unique for each group otherwise your server will crash when it starts up.
