Here are some common Enshrouded issues, and how to fix them.

### Character Is Not Saving

By default, Enshrouded save files will be stored on the Steam cloud.

To disable this open Steam, and go to `Library > Enshrouded > Properties > Toggle Steam Cloud Off`. Now saves will only be stored on your computer, you may always enable this again if you'd like to try and upload your saves to the cloud in the future.

Be sure to restart your game if you did this while it was running.

### Connecting anonymously to Steam Public...Retrying

You will likely be unable to connect to your server while Steam is down for maintenance, or has an outage. The only solution is to wait 5-10 minutes and try again. That being said, you can also try setting auto update to 0 in `Configuration > Startup Parameters` to attempt a connection.

### Server Is Not Showing Up In The Browser

Your server likely needs to be updated. You can restart your server to apply the latest update or follow our Enshrouded server update [guide here](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/enshrouded/update-your-server/).

If your server has been updated and still isn't showing up, you may have to wait a couple of minutes to let the in-game server browser load.

If your server still isn't showing up, try to connect directly, by using the Steam browser following [this guide](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/enshrouded/connect-to-your-server/).
