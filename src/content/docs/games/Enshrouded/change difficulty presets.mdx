In this guide, we will show you how to change the server difficulty on your [Enshrouded server](https://www.gamehostbros.com/enshrouded-server-hosting/). 

## Difficulty Presets
By default, Enshrouded comes with 5 difficulty presets that you can use to quickly adjust how hard the game is. We allow you to adjust these directly from our Game Panel.
<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and Stop your Enshrouded server.
2. Go to `Configuration > Startup Parameters`.
3. Find the `Difficulty` setting and change it to the desired difficulty.
4. Start your server.
</Steps>
Here are the Enshrouded difficulty presets you can select and what they do.

- **Default** - The “Default” difficulty setting configures all values to default. It is the direct continuation of how Enshrouded was first configured and is the recommended setting for first-time players.
- **Relaxed** - The “Relaxed” preset reduces the amount of enemies and provides players with more resources and loot. This mode targets players who are most interested in base-building and light-hearted adventuring.
- **Hard** - The “Hard” preset increases the amount of enemies and makes them more aggressive to give players a tougher combat experience.
- **Survival** - The “Survival” preset is for those who seek some punishment with additional survival mechanics on top of more aggressive enemies.
- **Custom** - When “Custom” is selected, a long list of individual settings can be tweaked. This setting is required if you manually adjust your enshrouded_server.json file.

If you want to tweak individual game settings, you will need to do it from the `enshrouded_server.json` file and `Difficulty` must be set to `Custom` in our game panel, our guide on that can be found here:
