At Game Host Bros, we understand the importance of flexibility. That's why we allow you to change your game to something different if required.

**Before proceeding, please note:**
- Your next invoice will be changed to the value of the new game.
- If you only just purchased your server, you may be asked to pay the price difference upfront.
- Any existing data will not be migrated to the new server so you must backup and **DOWNLOAD** your files if you want to retain any data prior to making your request.

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Billing Portal](https://portal.gamehostbros.com/).
2. In the header, select `Open Ticket`.
3. State the game you would like to be migrated to and confirm you've already backed up and downloaded your existing files.
</Steps>
