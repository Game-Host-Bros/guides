## FAQ

**Q: Will I automatically be refunded?**

**A:** You will only be automatically be refunded if you're within the 7-day refund period and have selected **immediate termination**. If you have selected end of billing cycle you will not receive an auto refund as people do this when they only want the server for 1 month. 


**Q: Do you save my files once my server is canceled?**

**A:** No. Once your server is canceled with us all of your files are deleted once the cancellation is processed. If you want to save your files you must back up and download them prior to placing your cancellation request.
