At Game Host Bros, we prioritize your account security. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second verification step when logging in, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your account.

**Before proceeding, please note:**
- You'll need a compatible authenticator app on your mobile device (like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator).
- Once enabled, you'll need both your password and the authentication code to access your account.
- Store your backup codes in a safe place in case you lose access to your authenticator app.

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Billing Portal](https://portal.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Navigate to the [Security Settings](https://portal.gamehostbros.com/user/security) page.
3. Under the "Two-Factor Authentication" section, click `Enable`.
4. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app or manually enter the provided key.
5. Enter the 6-digit verification code from your authenticator app to confirm setup.
6. Save the backup codes displayed on the screen to a secure location.
7. Click `Finish Setup` to complete the process.
</Steps>

After enabling 2FA, you'll be required to enter a verification code from your authenticator app each time you log in, providing enhanced security for your Game Host Bros account.
