At Game Host Bros, you have a separate Billing Portal and Game Panel account. This means that if you change the password in the Billing Portal for example, you must also change your Game Panel password (Unless you want them different).

- Billing Portal Password Reset Page: https://portal.gamehostbros.com/password/reset
- Game Panel Password Reset: https://panel.gamehostbros.com/ and click "Struggling to login"

Please be aware that if you've updated your email in the Billing portal, you will need also need to change your email in the Game Panel too.

If you get stuck with this then please open a support ticket, and we will help you get any issues resolved.
