At Game Host Bros, we understand the importance of flexibility. That's why we allow you to relocate your server to another location when needed. Our staff manually handles these transfer requests, typically completing them within 12 hours of your request.

**Before proceeding, please note:**
- Servers will only be relocated if that location is in stock.
- Your IP address and port for your game server will change, and this cannot be reverted.
- Any existing backups will not be migrated to the new location.

<Steps>
1. Login to the [Billing Portal](https://portal.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Under Your `Active Products/Services`, look for the service you want to upgrade and click `VIEW DETAILS`.
3. In the sidebar on the left, select `Actions > Upgrade/Downgrade Options`.
4. Select the location you want and then press `Continue`.
</Steps>
