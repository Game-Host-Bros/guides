By default, we give you space to backup your server incase you need to rollback to a previous configuration.

1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/).
2. Select your server.
3. In the left-hand menu, click `Management > Backups`.
4. Click the `Create` button.
5. Give your backup a name and click `Submit`.

It will then start a backup. During this time your server will be shut down until the backup is finished.

:::note
There are some files we don't back up such as `.log` files or `.vpk` files. The reason for this is they're of no use in most cases and place unnessecery load on our servers. If you require these files you will need to create your own backup solution. We can help you get this setup so its all automated and suits your needs.
