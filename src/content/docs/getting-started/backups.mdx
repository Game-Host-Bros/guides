By default, we give you space to backup your server incase you need to rollback to a previous configuration.
<Steps>
1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. In the left-hand menu, click `Management > Backups`.
3. Click the `Create` button.
4. Give your backup a name and click `Submit`.
</Steps>
It will then start a backup. During this time your server will be shut down until the backup is finished.

:::note
In most cases we only backup critical save game files and configuration files. This differs for each game. The reason for this is most files are of no use in most cases and place unnessecery load on our servers. You can see what is included by performing a backup of your server instance and then downloading it. If you require every file in your server instance, you will need to create your own backup solution using SFTP and a service like [Multcloud](https://www.multcloud.com/).
