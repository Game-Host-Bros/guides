At Game Host Bros, we give you 5GB of cloud storage to backup your game server with. This will backup the most important parts of your game server such as the save folder, configs, plugins etc (This differs for each game). 

:::note
We primarily back up critical save game and configuration files to reduce unnecessary server load. To see what's included, create and download a backup to your PC. If you need all files, set up your own backup solution using SFTP and a service like [Multcloud](https://www.multcloud.com/).
