<Steps>
1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. In the left-hand menu, click `Management > Databases`.
3. Click the `Create` button.
4. Fill out the following details:
   - **Host:** Select a host that is closes to your game server.
   - **Name:** The name for the database itself.
   - **Connections From:** Leave this as `%` unless you want to whitelist your server IP address.
</Steps>
Now you can locate the plugin you'd like to use the MySQL database for. Open the plugin's configuration file and input the database details correctly. You will need to refer to the documentation of the plugin for the specific location.

- Deleting your database will remove all the information in that database instantly.
- Backups do not include databases, and we cannot restore a deleted database.
- The MySQL port is always, 3306.

## Reset A Database Password
Sometimes you may need to reset a database password for whatever reason. This is how you can do it.

1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. In the left-hand menu, click `Management > Databases`.
3. Find the database you created, and youâ€™ll see the **JDBC Connection String**.
