You can set up schedules to restart your server, send commands, or do game-specific tasks such as wiping Rust servers.

:::note
When setting up the schedule, the time is in UTC +0. We suggest you restart your servers at least once every 24 hours for the best possible performance.
:::
<Steps>
1. Load the [Game Host Bros Panel](https://panel.gamehostbros.com/) and select your server.
2. In the left-hand menu, click `Configuration > Schedules`.
3. Click the `Create` button.
4. Give your schedule a name, in this example we will use "Restart" as the name.
5. Put in the time you want the server to perform the action [in cron format](https://crontab.guru/). For example, to run the Restart at 10 UTC, I would put in 0 10 * * *.
6. It will now say AT 10:00, Next run at November 29, 2023 @ 6:00 PM. That means at 6:00PM your time the schedule will run.
7. Click Submit and then `Create Task` on the top right and select the type of Task you want to perform. Example: we use power action, and restart.
</Steps>
If you have multiple tasks you want to run, for example you want to run a save command then then restart the server, you can use the `Time Offset` function. This is measued in seconds and its the delay from when your last task was run.

Here is a video we've made for schedules. While the Game Panel looks slightly different, the functionality is the same.
